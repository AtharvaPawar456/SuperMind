Trauma is the true cause of addiction, disease, apathy and hopelessness as well as the drive for power and prestige. Trauma's effects are equally opportunistic, as evident by those who jump to their death from the Golden Gate Bridge or the towers of high financeMany of us did not experience observable trauma, instead, we grew up in the presence of others who were victims of trauma. The effects of trauma spreads much like a virus. These include an inability to sustain intimate bonds with others. This intimacy deficiency is the root cause of isolation and undue sufferingPrevious generations have distorted the expression of love into a destructive projection. Every generation has projected their destructive concepts of love upon the next. These rituals begin when we are too young to repel their offerings. In our youth we accept the dysfunction of those who came before us. As we have children we grow older we pass on the very same dysfunction to our childrenIn precious moments of human development between an innocent child and their care providers ensues some of the most tragic crimes against man. The mental and emotional health of a child becomes compromised through a direct violation of trust and emotional need. Parents, themselves survivors of trauma, often see the unconditional love inside their children's eyes and have the most unfortunate response. The distorted perception of their unconscious character sees the love in a child's eyes as a threat to their own trauma conditioned identity. They set forth to reject this opportunity to love because they cannot surrender their investment in the unlovable beast they believe themselves to be. We have discovered that parents will unconsciously project this distortion into the subconscious of their own child as they had done unto them in their days of approximate youth. This unconscious initiation from one generation to the next is the mode by which the trauma virus is kept aliveThrough researching our member's trauma history, we have arrived at some discoveries which must be revealed. In many cases, the abuse between the adult and child occurred around the same time of the child's development that the adult was traumatized. The adult gives a devastating and distorted conception of love in order to relate with the child in a sick, yet familiar way. This is the only way some parents know how to relate. In these instances, the parent disassociates in a similar way as when they were the recipient of trauma in childhood. Much like the physical act of cutting or its emotional equivalent, the perpetrator is overcome and goes into a tranceThe most vicious criminals currently sitting behind bars have absorbed some of the worst traumas known to man. The homeless who wander the streets uttering fragmented thoughts have been equally affected by trauma. The bankers on Wall Street who are driven to acquire at the expense of a nation are also trauma survivors. None of these examples should be judged. They are effects that we all share the burden of correctingIn this age, humans lack vulnerability in their communion with one another.

While rushing to the doctor on bike, I shook him hard; screaming his name hopelessly in panic. “Shayan, wake up”. “Shayan, what happened to you, son”.Right then, I thankfully realized of Resuscitation! And quickly gave him mouth to mouth breathing twice, ; Shayan opened his eyes hardly, and vomited. Very dull, very weakly he moved a little. But he opened his eyes!We reached at the doctor's clinic, who checked him, Shayan was badly shivering with fever, very sleepy and dull. They did some tests, doctor told me that my son is fine nowI didn't believe him, went outside and got a cab, rushed to one of the best hospital's pediatric emergency, while going there Shayan vomited on me twice, big vomits both times. Hospital immediately took him in, checked and told me that Shayan is fine, there's nothing seriously concerning about him at the moment, tests came clear, it was an abdominal infection. They gave him three big injections, and right after the injections were done, Shayan's shivering stopped, yes he was still dull and weak but he looked better nowI and my wife stayed for some time and later left on doctors' adviceI think, what actually happened was that after arriving home from doctor's, my wife gave him the prescribed anti-biotic syrup and that resulted in some worse type of reaction.

He's on medicine but he's relatively active and I think I'm satisfied with his condition now, he's recoveringThanks goodness, he's okayBut what do I do with that heart-wrenching memory of looking at him laying on the cold floor miserably after he collapsed unconscious, how do I forget that I held and carried my son and he wasn't moving, he felt nothing like but just a weight. What do I do with that experience of panic, pain and horror when I wasn't sure what is happening and is my son going to wake up or not!I had never thought of going through something like this with my child, I want to scream in pain so god-damned loud that it bursts my lungs or something. I want to drop so many tears, I want to say that I have gotten very terrified in a way that I felt never before. The emotional shock has been way too overwhelming to handle but of course to any naked eye, I'm looking perfectly stable and fine as always in home or at workI wish him good healthy long lifeAnd I most sincerely wish and pray that you reading this; never get to experience a panicking horror like that! I really do!",
                    "My six years old son Shayan wasn't feeling well so her mother took him to doctor nearby, I was extremely busy doing my work from home. They went and half an hour later returned with medicine. That same time my younger brother came on his bike to visit us along with his family.",

                    "I didn't believe him, went outside and got a cab, rushed to one of the best hospital's pediatric emergency, while going there Shayan vomited on me twice, big vomits both times. Hospital immediately took him in, checked and told me that Shayan is fine, there's nothing seriously concerning about him at the moment, tests came clear, it was an abdominal infection. They gave him three big injections, and right after the injections were done, Shayan's shivering stopped, yes he was still dull and weak but he looked better now.",

Then imagine being thrust into life where you have to appear statusquo and act appropriately. Then imagine the overwhelming fear that stays with you when there is a noise, or a smell, or a colour, or a song that makes you immediately feel like you are back in the situation. Then imagine that everything you remember about the person who was supposed to love and protect you is about fear and horror but you still blame yourself because there is no way someone could be that evil. Imagine not being able to hold down a job because every time you hear a mad voice, or someone asserting authority you disappear completely from the situation because your body thinks something is going to happen again. Take all of that and multiply it and then you might have a small understanding of what trauma is."

Our system has very primitive defenses and doesn't understand well-being. It only cares about surviving even at the cost of the quality of your life.

So it is good that you're asking for helpAfter being diagnosed withdepression, I was prescribed two months medical leave. The short story is that I could no longer do my job effectively, and I changed careersIn my year in my second job, I experienced the same feeling of stress. The problem didn't go away. But now I had a word for it. I came to learn that stress, like every negative feeling, was a way for my mind to give me feedbackThe feeling of stressis there to tell me thatI perceive that I lack the resources, time or capability to do everything wellNot everything needs to be done well. But how to tell which?I developed a system to address this problem and till today I still use it whenever I feel stressed. Here's how you can use it:The IXU System of PrioritisationTake a piece of paper. Or use a spreadsheet. It's easierIn the first column, write the header “Task”. Under this column write out every single thing that you need to do for work. One task per row. I typically have about when I reach the stress feelingWhen you're done, scroll back to the top. In the next column, write down Urgency. For each of the tasks, rank the urgency with the smallest number being the most urgent. I use the following: - needs to be done asap2 - needs to be done by the end of today3 - needs to be done in the next days4 - needs to be done in the next one week5 - not needed this weekYou can devise your own ranking or urgencyIn the third column, write Importance. I normally do Importance before Urgency, but since you're new to this, it's easier to get Urgency out of the way firstUrgency has a time factor. Importance doesn't. Importance has to do with the question, “Does it matter in the long run? Will doing this help me move closer to my life goals?”While this does take some time to reflect, I'm assuming you need to create the space to do this first. Let's put some arbitrary goals:Career advancement, More personal time, Earn more moneyYou can change these laterGo back to each task and rank them according how important they are in relation to your goals. Again, the smaller the number, the higher the importanceFor example, tasks that has to do with a major work project for a client would have a higher importance than, say, helping to organize the office partyIn the column, write weight. Weight is the Importance ranking multiplied by the Urgency ranking. Hence I X U. Do this for all the tasks. You can use a formulaNow you have the weights, sort the table according to weight, in ascending order. You now have your tasks sorted according to the ones that are most important AND most urgentYou are not required to do all the tasks. At the bottom of the table are the tasks that are neither important nor urgent. Doing them will not matter to you in the long run. They should not be done at allOnce you start work, focus on the first one in your list. Do it as far as you can get, before moving to the next one. And the next. If you get distracted by someone or something - an interruption, a phone call - come back to the list to remind yourself what's the most important and most urgent thing you need to be working on nowIf your boss gives you new work and says he wants it done ASAP, add it to the list, give it a ranking for importance and urgency, find the weight and sort the list again. Let the system prioritise it for you. Trust the system. It worksIf you get through items on this list, you have had a productive day. Allow yourself to call it quits for the day. If you have time or you want to, move on to the next item. But if it's time to go home, put down the list and go homeAt the start of every day, spend minutes updating the list, and sort it again before you get started on the day's workSome days you will only be able to do items. That's fine. Because you are always working on the tasks that are most important and most urgent at any point of timeWhat do you do after office hours? Recharge. You're an introvert. Spend time by yourself. Hours if you have to. Do the things you enjoy. When's the last time you read a good book? Or watched a movie by yourself? Or took a long walk in the park by yourself? Or went to the gym and worked out?These are not less important than your work. These are what you do to recharge, so that when you get back to work, you're more focused, more creative, more productiveOne last thing. The feeling of stress will not go away unless you do something that alleviates it. It is like the dashboard of your car. The feeling of stress is like the indicator that tells you your engine is overheatingRight now, you don't know what the indicator is telling you, so you soldier on ignoring the warning sign, and eventually the engine will overheat and stall. You will have to stop for a while and let the engine cool before you continueAfter a while, the indicator will flash again, because you have not addressed the root cause of it. This cycle will keep happening and you may end up damaging your engine, like I didStress, if unrelieved, turns first into frustration, which you're already at. If it continues to be unrelieved, it turns into depression. Trust me, you don't want to let it get to this stageAll the best",

Cherish the time that you are able to spend in the quiet, doing what you want to do, when you want to do it. Do something for yourself something to pamper yourself. Do something when you feel lonely, that makes you feel happy!There's nothing wrong with the way you feel, it's a perfectly normal feeling. You need to change the the way you perceive your feelings of loneliness. Are you lonely because you are a single person who lives alone? Or are you lonely because the people that are around you do not engage you enough?It's OK to feel lonely, I often do myself, it's temporary. Before you know it, there's chaos all around and that loneliness that you didn't want to feel, is now a desireDo you give others the impression that you aren't enjoying your time spent with them? Do you really want to be left alone? Why are you alone? That is, if you are actually alone, or perhaps you're in the company of others and feel alone. As I said, being lonely and being alone are two different categories. Because you're alone, doesn't mean you should feel lonely. Because you could be not alone, yet lonelyThink about why you posed this question. Were you sitting home, alone, on the couch, surfing the internet and watching tv, wishing that someone was sitting next to you? If so, I can understand the sadness and frustration in today's world, it's difficult to make new friends and memories, unfortunately that comes with being a single person, and wishing that you had someone to share life withBut that person would not be responsible for your happiness. You are % responsible for your happiness. And that being said, Get busy. Get out and do something somewhere, something that you enjoy, perhaps something that you once enjoyed that you no longer do. A hobby, concert, hiking, fishing?? There's something out there that makes you smile!When you start smiling again, your attitude will change, you'll be full of good energy and more positive, your soul will be filled with joy, accomplishment, success… Soon others will notice and they will start smiling, because you are, and before you know it, you will feel much happier. You'll be genuinely happier! And much more content with your being and your life! You're going to attract new people who may become friends, and life will get better, you won't feel as lonely as you once didLoneliness is felt by people who are surrounded by love and also those who are not.

However, I quickly realized that I was the only one keeping track of how many things were on my plate, and it wasn't until I had my first big slip-up that I saw the flaw in my strategy. Remember, it's better to say no than accept and fail in the processCommunication is key here. The more honest you are about your workload and how you're feeling, the easier it is for your boss to help you prioritize. Being successful on the job isn't how many projects you're able to power through, it's about how much quality work you're putting out. Quality over quantity, alwaysStop focusing on all the negativesIn my experience, the majority of negativity stems from miscommunication. For example, when I felt like I had been passed up for a promotion, I turned my manager into the enemy. I started to feel like she didn't value me and that all of my hard work was going unnoticed. Of course, this was a gross over-exaggeration, but that's what happens when you internalize everything that's bothering you. One unresolved issue breeds a thousand, and pretty soon, you're wallowing in the negativitySo now, if I find myself falling down the rabbit hole of negativity, I check myself. I'm upset, so what's the real issue, and what am I doing to fix it? On too many occasions, I've realized that I haven't taken a single proactive step to resolve the situation. In so many ways, we are the makers and breakers of our own unhappiness, so if something isn't sitting right with you, start thinking about what you can do to make it betterAsk for help when you need itWhen I first joined the workforce, I overheard a member of my team complaining about how one of the new hires was asking her too many questions. I got nervous; I didn't want to bother anyone. So I tried to figure everything out on my own. Thankfully, Google was very handy in these times of need, but it was slowing me down. I was new, still trying to get my footing, and too scared to ask for help for fear of alienating my coworkers. Finally, I realized that I would rather come across as annoying than not be able to get my work done properly and on timeLooking back, I realize just how silly I was being. You should never be afraid to ask for help. The whole point of having a team is that you're not in it alone. It is so important to find support that you can rely on in the workplace. You'd be amazed by how wonderful people can be if you give them a chanceEmbrace your slip-upsWe spend our entire lives trying to avoid mistakes, minimize them, and do everything perfectly. But in truth, mistakes are so important. They help you realize where you have room to improve. So when something goes wrong, use it as a learning experience and figure out what you could have done differently. It isn't about punishing yourself or getting reprimanded. Every mistake is an opportunity to learn and growMistakes also allow us to learn how to forgive ourselves. We're human, and that means we're imperfect. We're all bound to mess up every now and then, and we shouldn't run from that. So make mistakes. Mess up. Fall on your face. But learn from it. Ultimately, it's your failures that end up being the best motivatorsRemember to prioritize yourselfOne of the best things you can do for your mental health is to put yourself first. Get a good night's sleep, stay hydrated, spend time with people you love, or really, whatever it is that helps you unwind. Even if you have a demanding job, you don't need to be “on” /. One of the best ways to keep your work anxiety from spiraling out of control is making sure that you are doing enough for yourselfAnd remember, anxiety is normal. We all feel it from time to time. The key here is to not let it take over your entire life and spiral out of control. The more you face adversity and learn how to overcome it, the stronger you will be in the long run. You will have good days and bad days, maybe even bad months or years. But it's how you choose to deal with the setbacks that matters the most. Don't let your anxiety win.",

                "So after letting my anxiety rule my sense of self-worth for far too long, I finally realized that enough was enough. I decided to make a few changes to regain control, and I came up with a few rules to keep myself in check if things started to spiral.",

                "I've struggled with anxiety for the majority of my life. I always figured that it would get easier with time, but in truth, life never stops being stressful. It was the worst its ever been when I graduated from college and officially joined the workforce. The transition from being a student to working full-time was rough, and it didn't help that I wasn't in love with my first job. I spent so many sleepless nights overthinking just about everything you can imagine, from imminent deadlines and upcoming project reviews, to big-picture stressors like whether or not I felt successful and if my achiContinue Reading"

                "I have one older brother who is five years older than me. He took to my mother's side. So my mom's side of the family loves him just for genetic resemblance. On top of that, I ended up becoming fat after appendectomy so that added more to lack of attention towards me. Mom hated my dad's side of the family. She wanted everyone in the house to stop talking to them, including my dad! I took to dad's side of the family. They loved me more than my brother for the genetic resemblance. But I did not get their love in full because my mom made me cutoff from them. Most of your confidence comes from the amount of love you received during childhood. Negligent parents, lack of loving family or friends are some of the main reasons to lose confidence very early on in life. My mom just cared for my physical health, by making sure I ate on time. My dad made sure I was good at math so that I did not end up becoming a liability to him once I grew up. That's it. Not once did they ask me if I am making friends in school, as to why I feel so lonely (despite the fact that I used to complain pretty much every day that I feel lonely). After years of negligence during my childhood, he is now, out of the blue, attached to me. Why? I went to IITM and got a BTech in EE, went on to get a PhD, and have made a lot of money.

                "Indian parents in general (and I have heard the same about most parents, irrespective of race/nationality, but I am not sure), are possessive. To put it bluntly, a son is not so much of a son but more like a doll or a bonded laborer. His job is to fit into the image that the parents have, about him. For women, parents usually just want to get rid of her asap, but to a family which their social circle will accept the relationship. How many parents truly care if the child is happy? Sometimes, they don't even ask. I know my parents didn't. They know that if they ask, then they will get an answer, mandating them to do things they will never do, which leads me to the next point.",
                "I was in a certain challenging field in electrical engineering which is filled with egoistic weasels. They are competitive, and mean. They appear friendly but really, they are “frenemies”. Beware of the difference between true friends, and frenemies. Among my peers, there are none who are true friends. They are competitive, and if at all I get something good in life, they'll be just jealous. Choose a career which is worth the time you give it. The common advice is “get into a career that is fulfilling, and don't get into a career just because it is lucrative.” That's bullshit. As men, we are born with the debt of having to have a mortgage free home in a city of our liking, and having to have enough funds to raise a couple of children and perhaps put them through college. I am assuming you don't get divorced like me, and in case you do, then know this. Your life, and particularly the financial aspect of it, will be totally screwed. Based on the rough estimate to buy a house, and the college education fees, you can put a dollar value on this “inherent debt” that us men are born with. If your career does not align with your financial goals, ditch it. In case you are a woman, then your issue is most likely to find a mate before you hit the wall. So plan your life and career accordingly. I gave this spiel about career choice because important decisions like that of career, if gone wrong, can leave you lonely. While your buddies (who are mostly frenemies) might be, at the outset, enjoying the “right choices” that they claim to have made, you will be sitting on a mountain of difficult problems.",

You know what his answer was? His answer was “just get married and everything will be fine.” I lost a decade of my life in a bad marriage. Fortunately, I don't have a child. But then, I have been setback by years in my personal life. The worst part of a bad marriage is that you feel lonely, when you are physically near your wife/husband. Imagine that happening for years.

Remember that guilt is their ultimate weapon because for a grown child, physical force is out of question and the only weapon they have, in order to manipulate you, is to use guilt. Solution: After a certain age, stop sharing your life details with them, and grow apart both physically and more importantly, emotionally. If you don't, then you might be physically in the US, but they can keep manipulating you right from here in India using the damn cellphone technology. In case you are still a child, you need to start rebelling against them, not in a violent way, but in a verbally assertive way. If they are creating an “I love you more than anything else” drama, tell them how they have failed you and ask them if that's how much they love you. You need to start catching their bullshit early on, and make them know that you are not a bonded laborer, and that they cannot be possessive pricks.

                "It's a bit ironic that I was asking the same question a few years back, but now, I am actually answering it. How I wish I could answer non-anonymously :(. My dad follows me on Quora so I do not want him to know I wrote this answer in publicThe following is just information about my life. It may not actually answer your question, but in case some of my experiences resonate with yours, then this information could help youI have one older brother who is five years older than me. He took to my mother's side. So my mom's side of the family loves him just for genetic resemblance. On top of that, I ended up becoming fat after appendectomy so that added more to lack of attention towards me. Mom hated my dad's side of the family. She wanted everyone in the house to stop talking to them, including my dad! I took to dad's side of the family. They loved me more than my brother for the genetic resemblance. But I did not get their love in full because my mom made me cutoff from them. Most of your confidence comes from the amount of love you received during childhood. Negligent parents, lack of loving family or friends are some of the main reasons to lose confidence very early on in life. My mom just cared for my physical health, by making sure I ate on time. My dad made sure I was good at math so that I did not end up becoming a liability to him once I grew up. That's it. Not once did they ask me if I am making friends in school, as to why I feel so lonely (despite the fact that I used to complain pretty much every day that I feel lonely). After years of negligence during my childhood, he is now, out of the blue, attached to me. Why? I went to IITM and got a BTech in EE, went on to get a PhD, and have made a lot of money. So now, all of a sudden, I am important to himIndian parents in general (and I have heard the same about most parents, irrespective of race/nationality, but I am not sure), are possessive. To put it bluntly, a son is not so much of a son but more like a doll or a bonded laborer. His job is to fit into the image that the parents have, about him. For women, parents usually just want to get rid of her asap, but to a family which their social circle will accept the relationship. How many parents truly care if the child is happy? Sometimes, they don't even ask. I know my parents didn't. They know that if they ask, then they will get an answer, mandating them to do things they will never do, which leads me to the next pointMy dad used to tell me, all the time, that he wants to be a “different dad.” He said that “his dad did not bond with him emotionally”. The reality is something I recently discovered through extensive therapy sessions. He wanted an emotional hook. Do you understand what I mean? Just imagine yourself to be a puppy. Parents feed the puppy, and fulfill the desires of the puppy,as long as it aligns with their interests. They also fill in empty words of love like “if I could, I will donate all my spiritual points due to my good deeds, towards your happiness.” Just tell them someday that you are in love with a Musilm girl in case you are a Hindu, and vice versa. :). Let alone Muslim, they would not agree even if it were to be a different subcaste among Hindus. Words of love and care are all emotional hooks tokeep you feeling guilty, in case you don't listen to them. Remember that guilt is their ultimate weapon because for a grown child, physical force is out of question and the only weapon they have, in order to manipulate you, is to use guilt. Solution: After a certain age, stop sharing your life details with them, and grow apart both physically and more importantly, emotionally. If you don't, then you might be physically in the US, but they can keep manipulating you right from here in India using the damn cellphone technology. In case you are still a child, you need to start rebelling against them, not in a violent way, but in a verbally assertive way. If they are creating an “I love you more than anything else” drama, tell them how they have failed you and ask them if that's how much they love you. You need to start catching their bullshit early on, and make them know that you are not a bonded laborer, and that they cannot be possessive pricks. Break free from them in emotionally before you leave your house for education/jobBody image is another factor that prevents you from getting attention from people, leading to lack of confidence, leading to depression and loneliness. The most attractive ones tend to end up becoming confident, while the fat and unattractive ones will be mostly made fun of. Society is pretty nasty and there are not many angels out there. Solution: Get rid of body fat. Learn about good carbs and bad carbs. Learn about role of diet in weight loss. Do whatever it takes to get into shape. You will see how the society will reward you with attention, just for being physically leanMine was an arranged marriage. After getting engaged, I specifically remember having told my father, that I don't like this girl and that we should call off the wedding. You know what his answer was? His answer was “just get married and everything will be fine.” I lost a decade of my life in a bad marriage. Fortunately, I don't have a child. But then, I have been setback by years in my personal life. The worst part of a bad marriage is that you feel lonely, when you are physically near your wife/husband. Imagine that happening for years. This ties into my earlier point about moving away from parents emotionally as soon as you get a chance to be able to do thatI was in a certain challenging field in electrical engineering which is filled with egoistic weasels. They are competitive, and mean. They appear friendly but really, they are “frenemies”. Beware of the difference between true friends, and frenemies. Among my peers, there are none who are true friends. They are competitive, and if at all I get something good in life, they'll be just jealous. Choose a career which is worth the time you give it. The common advice is “get into a career that is fulfilling, and don't get into a career just because it is lucrative.” That's bullshit. As men, we are born with the debt of having to have a mortgage free home in a city of our liking, and having to have enough funds to raise a couple of children and perhaps put them through college. I am assuming you don't get divorced like me, and in case you do, then know this. Your life, and particularly the financial aspect of it, will be totally screwed. Based on the rough estimate to buy a house, and the college education fees, you can put a dollar value on this “inherent debt” that us men are born with. If your career does not align with your financial goals, ditch it. In case you are a woman, then your issue is most likely to find a mate before you hit the wall. So plan your life and career accordingly. I gave this spiel about career choice because important decisions like that of career, if gone wrong, can leave you lonely. While your buddies (who are mostly frenemies) might be, at the outset, enjoying the “right choices” that they claim to have made, you will be sitting on a mountain of difficult problemsUltimately, it is possible to feel lonely in-spite of having made all the right choices in life, having had exceptional parents, who unconditionally love you and are not possessed by possessiveness, and that you may not have any body image issues. The feeling of loneliness for me is at its lowest when I am around people with whom I can connect well, and enjoy their company very much. Try to get into activities which might lead you into such friendshipsWeirdly, when my therapist told me that most human beings feel lonely quite a few times in life, it somehow made me feel a little better. The “I am not the only one with this problem” realization is perhaps the most universal solution to most psychological problems, many of which are not spoken of in the open. Perhaps, that can help you as well. So don't despair. We are in this together my friend!"

                "Set yourself up for success rather than failureDon't waste time applying for jobs you know you can't get “in the hopes maybe they'll take a chance on you!” They won't, and you'll only stress more about hearing back, and feel worse when you get rejectedIt's okay to apply for mundane jobs so you can collect a paycheck while you spend more time trying to find a job you actually like, maybe working on the certifications or licenses you'll need for that bigger job you want—and the structure and routine of working and following a schedule can actually distract enough to take some stress off, especially if it's a job you know you can do easilyDoing well at a job can boost your confidence, even if you don't love the job. In this situation, give yourself reality checks; remind yourself that it's only temporary and not a lot is riding on you keeping the job because you're just there to take up space on a resume while you search for your fit. Customer service and retail jobs can be done by an ice cream cone, they just suck. So don't take it too seriouslyReframe whatever situation you're in job-wise, and give yourself realistic and easily achievable expectations and goals. Don't spend hours a day every day staring at job listings on your computer, you'll be miserable. After being unemployed for a while and stressing about not being able to get a job, I reprogrammed my approach: “I will apply for jobs a day, then let myself relax because I accomplished something (no matter how inconsequential it may seem to others).”In the application stage, try not to check your email or voicemails every minutes. Check once or twice a day. If you can avoid obsessing over hearing back, it can be less stressfulIf you have a certain career in mind, start out with the simple jobs in that career to get your foot in the door. If you want to work with animals, become a vet tech if you have the means to. Hell, even just apply to work at the front desk of a vet clinic. It's mostly administrative, but you'll get to be exposed to animals and may learn from it, and it can boost your drive to maybe go back to school and become a large-animal vetIn my experience, from what I've seen with friends and family, don't just get into real estate or insurance because you need a job. I'd recommend you only go into it if you are actually interested in selling properties or life insurance. A lot of people get their real estate license because it's easy and everyone says you make a lot of money! (This is usually a cry for help, as most people actually don't make a lot of money and it can be soul-sucking if your heart's not in it. My cousin was an insurance agent after his first tour in Afghanistan, and genuinely yearned for the permanent sleep until he was called back for active duty and rose through the ranks, retiring happily as a Lt. Col.)It's okay to work a few odd jobs here and there. Learn what you like and understand what's a dealbreaker for you for more permanent employmentDon't compare yourself to others, there's no timeline for landing your dream job, and be comfortable and confident in what that dream job is. If a – isn't for you, don't fret just because society has deemed that the only acceptable workforces are – M-F (somehow forgetting that doctors exist??) It's okay if your friend started their career fresh out of college and you haven't. It's okay if your classmates aren't working and you are. It's okay if your friends are full-time and you're part-time. You know you best. Do this at your own pace, you'll be happier and healthier for it.",

Stronger your faith in yourself, life, and most of all God, you will have a constant support. Whenever you feel traumatized, chant mantra, bhajan, look at the image of your beloved God, show faith in them, do good deeds for them, and improve the level of your bhakti (devotion.) God doesn't really mind how you picture him but feels your true love, trust, and devotion. Ask God to forgive your previous karma or sins and promise to do good deeds now, ask God not only to let you get over that traumatic situation but the severe anxiety you are facing because of it, and separate the two so that your mind also gets that.",

                "I have faced an unresolved trauma for a prolonged period influenced by a trigger that was very frequent in day-to-day life. I will give you some tips I followed and overcame itSelf-talk is the key here. Address that issue to yourself, convince yourself that life stands above and beyond it, and that you have the ability to overcome it. What is it is, it's reality, everything else is a thought of unrealistic expectations from life, you have to deal with it and you will deal with it eventually. Never self-blame or declare yourself weak. Realize that this can also happen to the people we say are made of steel. Nature is powerful enough. Always have compassion and respect for yourself. Protect your identity. Stand up for yourself in your vulnerable daysWhenever you feel strong and intense negative energy rushing inside your body, because of a trigger, decode it as trauma and not reality, and realize that the trigger isn't powerful or real enough but it's a deteriorated state of mind that's causing more suffering. The suffering must exist only up to one-third of what you feel right now and would be manageable. Accepting trauma as trauma, starting it from reality, and not staying unaware and confused is importantSometimes, you have to leave it as it is. Not every issue in life would have a solution and most wouldn't have an immediate solution. Also, some things in life don't work out by logic, effort or thinking, or maturity. Life corrects or mends itself. Keep the expectations on one side and avoid the constant burden of not being able to cope, manage or succeed or the fear of negative results. Life must go onThe best but the toughest way is to operate through mindfulness, which means, staying alive only in the present moment, and leaving your spectacle of wisdom and memory behindBe dumb when smartness is killing youThis trick can't be learned in one day, you need to practice. Pray when you pray, drive when you drive, eat when you eat, take a deep breath, speak to yourself that I am doing this activity, that's it. Feel your senses and try to be more aware and observant.

Well, it's a sign that you can still find happiness in life and mind, all you need is to shift your focusFaith can help you overcome the biggest of fears until they come true, and after that, you will deal with them and move on. Stronger your faith in yourself, life, and most of all God, you will have a constant support. Whenever you feel traumatized, chant mantra, bhajan, look at the image of your beloved God, show faith in them, do good deeds for them, and improve the level of your bhakti (devotion.) God doesn't really mind how you picture him but feels your true love, trust, and devotion. Ask God to forgive your previous karma or sins and promise to do good deeds now, ask God not only to let you get over that traumatic situation but the severe anxiety you are facing because of it, and separate the two so that your mind also gets that.",

                "Lonely you say! Lemme tell you an instance from my life. There has been many but this one is the latest of all. My birthday is on of Feb. Since my childhood, my birthday was never celebrated as we never had enough money to spend on these things. In my school, there used to be a classmate of mine whose birthday was also on the same day. He used to distribute chocolates and cakes , I being the recipient of all sitting in the class wishing I could do the same. Never told anyone about my birth date in my school. Time passed, I went to college. There was a girl there in my section whom I liked the most. We used to talk like anything. Our conversations will go whole of the night. Bunking classes, going out together, helping each other in difficult situations and all those romantic things happened. I proposed her and she acceptedI really thought She is the one. The first time she celebrated my birthday, I cried. Never ever anyone had done those things for me. Never ever I had cut any cake and people clapped over it. Small things matter to me a lot. I didn't had money those days so I skipped my meals to get her a ring. I tried my best to love her with all my heart. I had a lot of family issues , financial issues but one hug from her and I used to forget everythingI even had told about her to my family. I was dead sure that I am gonna marry herI was always there for her when she needed me. Be it the time when she didn't score a job in the college placements or the time when she was paranoid about the exams. She was good in studies and in a matter of time she bagged job offers from three companies. I told her to join the one which can actually value her potential and not to bother about me and her being in a same cityTime flew and she made a friend circle over there. Started spending time with them while I will be waiting every night to listen to her voice. The girl who never looked at any other guy made some really male “best friends “ over there. Partying all night, drinking, going for night outs became very common for her. Seldom I used to get proper replies from her. If I asked anything about her friends she used to get all angry about not having trust and allIt's been one and half year now since she broke up with me on whatsapp. Later I came to know the lies she made up to avoid me. It broke me. I cried everyday for an year, made cuts, suicidal thoughts and what not. My performance in my office went downhill. I used to go to parking lot to cry so that nobody could see me. And meanwhile I saw her status updates that how much happening her life is going onI became numb all the time with no feelings. I bought a guitar and practiced it everyday whenever I get any thoughts about her. There is a void I know , it can never be filled . Those memories can never be replaced. I became a better person after all thisThis Feb , my birthday, I bought a pack of chocolates to distribute into my office. Nobody wished, So I had them alone in my dinner.

                "Welleveryone wants a good salary, isn't it??? Stress comes later. Everyone wants well paying jobs so they can afford quality life. They can afford a good vehicle, they can rent a good apartment or build a good house, could provide well care to his loved ones, could spend on other accessories like branded items so they can highlight in the society, recognition among relatives & friends……list goes onWith time passes, we witness that our well paying job that brought all the comforts & recognition to our lives have invaded our physical, mental & social domains in a negative manner. The job has become everything & we live to work only, nothing elseYour appointment letter says you need to work hours for a week but actually you are spending more than – hours per week. You are leaving your home to office in early morning & returning late in the night fully exhausted & beatenYour appointment letter says Saturday is an off day but you find increasingly there are urgent reports to be made, need to engage in endless con-calls, e-mail threads, special or adhoc meetings, training sessions which will eat up entire Saturday…..so ironically Saturday becomes just another working dayYou increasingly find you have less & less time to spend time with your loved ones, your are missing your social touch, you have less time to engage with yourself, your home becomes a place you only come to change cloths, bath & sleep. You find you are transforming in to soulless machine. You start to irritate the presence of your loved ones & you're are tying to distant yourself from them. Boss, customers, co-workers have become more important to you than your family. You find you cannot live without your mobile phone. Simply you are missing the life itselfYou are getting fatter day by day or abnormally skinny day by day. Your eyes are swollen or area around your eyes are darken like you have come out of boxing match. Headaches, eye pains, back pains & joint pains have become part of your life. Ears are giving you pains due to constant engagement with lengthy phone calls. Eye sight is getting weaken every month passes. Sleep quota is gradually diminishing. Either you have less time to sleep or the sleep doesn't come to youCoffee or tea is your energy booster. You find you cannot live without minimum – cup of coffer or tea per day. Cigarette is you best buddy. That few minutes you spend with the cigarette is your most relaxing time during office hours. Your prefer junk food, outside food over the tasty & healthy home made food. Alcohol becomes an integral part of you because you find without it you cannot flush out the stress, depression, anxiety & all the negative energies have build up in your system. You will find you are getting heavily intoxicated quite – days per weekOne morning you wake up & ask your self, is it worth it? All these things I'm going through just to get a steady pay check at the end of the month, is it worth compare to the things I sacrifice? Where does this lead to? What will be the end? Rich or poor we all will dies someday & I'll not be taking any of these thing I have build & collected. If I die today, company will find another slave in matter of days. What the F**k is this? I'm going to f**king resign & going to find a job with less burden or start something small of my own. I don't mind a low salary/incomeOk but wait……I have the housing loan to be paid for another years. Car lease for another years. School & tuition fees of the kids. Wife/Husband's income is not stable. Add to this what will others think of me If I go to a low salary job. Will there be the same recognition? Will I be able to afford branded stuffs which I can afford now?Hmm…..I think I have to act this slave role for quite long time. I'm might die on the way to office or on the office desk, but bills need to be paid. Status need to be maintained. Debts need to be settledThis is the typical story of vast majority of employees. They are stuck in a loop that they will never get out of. So you need to decide what you want in your life. What is the ideal life you want. If you need to own a sport car, living in a mansion……then you need to work your ass off for it, unless you are born with silver spoons & gold forks. If your need to find real meaning of life, the purpose of existence & beyond that, you can be a clergyman or a monk so you could dedicated your life for that purpose. If you simply need some meals to fulfill hunger, some cloths to cover the body & a place to sleep…..then there are so many ways you could fulfill them without been drowned in these mental struggles like job related stress, depression, anxiety etcIts you, nothing else. You decide what is the life that you want. Don't give a f**k about what others think & quit from this bloody comparison game. If you constantly worry about what others think & if you are constantly comparing yourself to others, then you will never be able to get out of the stress cycle.",

What if you could be all that, and could play those harmonic sounds using varying water levels, on top of that?You see, you never know, what those % of pages treasure from youAnd to unearth that treasure, you need to spend some time on yourself, know yourselfTo dig to your abstract self, there is no other way than being aloneConsider any of the abstract artists. Ever heard them working with someone? Kalidas, Rahim, Rabindranath Tagore, Shakespeare, Pablo Picasso, anyone?More over, at times to follow your passion, there is no way left but to tread the path aloneNow, spending alone time with yourself implies that you do something with, from, through yourselfLet your imagination be wild.

Something abstract. Something completely different and new. Like go on a bike trip alone, or try writing a new story or poem or song, or any articleTry cooking. Cook the food you loved as a child. Go through your childhood pics as you have thatGo for a long walk, observe the path, the dirt and the people on themPsst...I myself am a bit autophobic. In fact when I was thinking about examples above, and came up with the bike trip one, I myself got a bit timid just imagining itBut I know that it's right, moreover it's fun. And I do do it at lower level on a regular basis. In fact I wrote pretty much of this, sitting in a secret place where no one enters while I am there. Even if I'd ask them toMy productivity increases when I am there. I never could make out why it was so.

I managed to get through all of this, graduating from school and going on to live my life. There was major trauma from all of this which caught up with me as an adult. I got into therapy and did intensive inner child work on my own. It was gut wrenching but it was worth the pain. You very much can live a normal life- a joyous life but working through your own ( we all have ‘something') trauma is the gateway to it. It's not for the feint of heartWe take on a lot of the crap from our parents: their own unresolved trauma. Many times they say: “I did the best I could.” I don't buy it. No you probably didn't do your best. You did what you knew which was limited from your own parents. We owe it to our kids to get ourselves straightened out from our own trauma so we can parent our kids to be emotionally healthy for the next generations.",

                "Dear friend,Stress is contemporary buzzword, brought to us by our lifestyle, expectation from life and misplaced beliefs and ideas about everything we doLet's look at it slowly and deeplyWe do not really need to fix it, but in understanding is the dissolution of itHave you ever noticed when are you stressed? Is it when you are immersed in anything or is it when you are thinking about anything? You would recognize that stress is always in the thought of somethingLet us do a small experiment right now. Start thinking about your ambitions and goals. Does along with it comes the thought of possible frustration, that I may not achieve my targets? Notice that. And the moment there is this thought, stress has creeped inKnow thisIn really living, in being there, is no stress but in anticipation, in planning, in targeting, in desirous thinking, there is a lot of stressLao Tzu says, “Do your work, then step back.”But we don't step back. We wait and wait, and this waiting creates time, this waiting creates future, this waiting is hope and expectations. And there is no suffering worse than hope. There is no torture, worse than, looking at future, in expectationLao Tzu is compassionate; he wants us to avoid the suffering that is totally avoidable, yet so chronically present in our livesHave you noticed that even when you just say a casual ‘Hi!' to somebody, there is an expectation of reciprocity involved there? It might be a faint expectation, nevertheless it is thereThat when you leave that small tip for the waiter in the restaurant, you expect to see gratitude on his face?We would never tip and forget. The action of giving a tip is coming from past believe system (we are taught so much etiquettes always) and not from just an immediate wish of gratitude that the fellow served me so wellWe don't step back. No action is ever complete, that is why we keep getting stuck in the ‘cause and effect' cycle. That is why freedom never comes to usOne action never gets completed in the moment; it only prepares the ground for the next inappropriate action. No action ever begins in the moment; it is always a carryover from the past. And no action ever gets completed in the moment, it always keep residue for the future.

Start small and soon you will see big changesPraise, bless, thank everywhere, everyone, every timeIt's a change in your attitude toward life. Give, do not take.",

                "I think of “trauma” as another word for “hurt” or “harm.” Trauma has a medical meaning that implies you've been hurt badly enough to need emergency treatment. So I guess trauma is any harm that requires immediate treatmentThe problem with psychological trauma is that the brain can supply immediate treatment. One of the immediate treatments is dissociation. Another is amnesia. So if you are traumatized, you may find yourself feeling separate from yourself, as the body and brain attempt to reduce the pain you are experiencing to a level you can surviveThere are lots of ways people dissociate, and I'm not going to try to describe them all here. But it is the vague sense of no longer fully experiencing your sensations and perceptions the way you usually do. Feelings may seem dulled. The world may seem more distant. You may find yourself watching yourself from outside yourself. Or you may even come to awareness with a sense that things happened but you don't know what they were. You missed them somehow. And the situation you find yourself in seem inexplicable and difficult to understand. That can be the result of amnesia: forgetting what just happenedSometimes, our brains are so clever, that we don't even notice the lost time. We pick up where we left off, and don't even notice there was some kind of gap or that things don't make sense. It can take years or even decades to catch on that there are inexplicable mysteries in your life or that your patterns of behavior just don't make any sense at allFor example, it took me decades to notice that I mistrust men. I never really questioned it. For the longest time, I just didn't trust men. I kind of noticed it, but just assumed that men are assholes, the way feminists might suggest. It never occurred to me that I might have a specific event that happened to me in childhood that would explain why I mistrust menSimilarly, I have engaged in a pattern of behavior that makes it difficult for me to have long term relationships. I was married for thirty years, so it seemed like I could have a long term relationship. It took me decades to notice that I was deeply unhappy in my marriage and that I had been in denial of my unhappiness for decades. I just assumed this was the way things were and my pain was just the way it was for everyone, not an unusual thingThen I discovered what might be a memory of an event that actually explains why I struggle with love relationships and why I mistrust men. I don't know if this is a real memory or not, so I am not going to describe it right now, but if it is true, it provides a reason for dozens of mysteries in my life. It explains my self-hatred. It explains why I feel like I don't matter. It explains why I don't trust men. It explains why I don't trust love. It explains why I am constantly afraid of being abandoned. It explains why I believe I am unlovable and unlikeable. It explains why I have never tried very hard to accomplish anything. It explains why I can't remember things about the past. It explains certain uncharacteristic things I've done. It explains certain aches and pains I have. It explains some of my off and on relationship with music. It explains why I have little confidence in myselfThese are some examples of signs of trauma that I discovered in myself. There are plenty of other signs, but each person who is traumatized will have their own, individual signs, so don't take these as a general rule.",

I just assumed this was the way things were and my pain was just the way it was for everyone, not an unusual thing.",
                "There are lots of ways people dissociate, and I'm not going to try to describe them all here. But it is the vague sense of no longer fully experiencing your sensations and perceptions the way you usually do. Feelings may seem dulled. The world may seem more distant. You may find yourself watching yourself from outside yourself. Or you may even come to awareness with a sense that things happened but you don't know what they were. You missed them somehow. And the situation you find yourself in seem inexplicable and difficult to understand. That can be the result of amnesia: forgetting what just happened."

Trauma is the true cause of addiction, disease, apathy and hopelessness as well as the drive for power and prestige. Trauma's effects are equally opportunistic, as evident by those who jump to their death from the Golden Gate Bridge or the towers of high financeMany of us did not experience observable trauma, instead, we grew up in the presence of others who were victims of trauma. The effects of trauma spreads much like a virus. These include an inability to sustain intimate bonds with others. This intimacy deficiency is the root cause of isolation and undue sufferingPrevious generations have distorted the expression of love into a destructive projection. Every generation has projected their destructive concepts of love upon the next. These rituals begin when we are too young to repel their offerings. In our youth we accept the dysfunction of those who came before us. As we have children we grow older we pass on the very same dysfunction to our childrenIn precious moments of human development between an innocent child and their care providers ensues some of the most tragic crimes against man. The mental and emotional health of a child becomes compromised through a direct violation of trust and emotional need. Parents, themselves survivors of trauma, often see the unconditional love inside their children's eyes and have the most unfortunate response. The distorted perception of their unconscious character sees the love in a child's eyes as a threat to their own trauma conditioned identity. They set forth to reject this opportunity to love because they cannot surrender their investment in the unlovable beast they believe themselves to be. We have discovered that parents will unconsciously project this distortion into the subconscious of their own child as they had done unto them in their days of approximate youth.

The adult gives a devastating and distorted conception of love in order to relate with the child in a sick, yet familiar way. This is the only way some parents know how to relate.

I wanted to take a year drop to study for engineering exams , but wasn't allowed by my family because they thought he will not make it , so had to join a Tier Engineering college. During these two years , I always thought how my love was , as I wasn't in touch with her for two yearsSo , I began to search her whereabouts everywhere : Instagram , Facebook etc. As I went through her posts , I saw a photo she was tagged on Facebook , she was with her girl friend and two boys.

He told me that one of the boys in that photo was her boyfriend and they are hanging out together since two yearsI was devastated. I felt really bad , so bad that I felt my heart breaking into tiny piecesI went into depression when I heard this news. Felt to punish myself for waiting for her for two years. I cried a lot that day. After a lot of crying , I decided I won't even see her face ever againSince then I went to college everyday , even though I hated it , I still went to prove that everyone was wrong to not to put trust over me. Study hard and go for higher studies was my ultimate aim. I was really motivated at this pointMy loneliness almost ended hereThen again,fate decided to test me by letting another girl ( or should I say b*tch) in my lifeWe happened to meet at a place where we met regularly, I slowly began to fall for her and we both began to flirt with each other. But here too , I began to doubt about her as that girl had a boyfriend three months ago and when a person breaks up , he/she usually is hesitant to get into another one. But yet, I decided to go along with the flow ( a disastrous mistake I've ever made in my life). I couldn't express myself completely in front of her , as I was too deeply in love with her and I was sort of shy towards her , she thought that I was nothing but a loser and so , she began to avoid me. I always knew that she avoided me , but I still used to like herSometimes , obsession for others makes our mental and emotional health unstable , so unstable that you begin to lose your sanity and your aim in life. Yes , I had become mentally unstableIt took my precious years of life to overcome this trauma. When I finally got on track , I came to know that she had got herself a boyfriend. Now that didn't matter to me anymore , to be honest , as I had decided to let her go off my lifeI again embraced my lonelinessAnd again,fate decided to test me again by letting me suffer from an illness whose cause was unknownThat illness was so severe that I lost kgs in two months. Depression was at peak and I thought of giving up on life. Doctor said that it might be a type of cancer. When I came to know this , I was again devastated. After all the trauma I suffered in life , I decided that my fate is destined to be a failure , I'll go along whatever happens to me nowHowever , doctors again retested me and assured me that it was just a temporary illness and I would be getting better in no timeAt this point , I had almost lost my inner confidence. I was completely exhausted by the events happened in my lifeHowever , after all this , I got up and tried to focus on my goal on becoming an MBA graduate from a top B schoolBefore my engineering , I had a good aptitude knowledge ( Quants , Verbal ). But now , I couldn't even do a single question of aptitude properlyI tried to work hard , as I had no one to guide me on this , I still failed but didn't give up. I didn't have friends to guide me as at this point I was all alone to do my studies. I gave all exams but failed in allI would be graduating this year and I still don't have a job offer in hand. But still I'm not gonna give upToday I'm a year old guy with no friends and a total loner. I may be a failure at this point but I'm sure I would be successful this yearI've embraced every circumstances that happened around with me and won't be giving upAs I look back , I still wonder how I even survived till this point.

Slowly, with the fear of society and their talking habits I stopped going out the houseMy mother rarely stepped out of her room. All we talked was during meals. We used to sit quiet. The silence was more hard for me. I couldn't share the things with anyone in the fear of being judged. So the loneliness was killing me from insideBut slowly I started becoming strong as the situation started becoming less hard. Society slowly forgot our issue as they got other things to talk aboutI started sharing my things with my friends. I started going out of the house more often and I tried keeping myself busy. I also started working as the translator for US based journalistMy mother started taking things light and started to talk. We used to talk and laugh on small things. We used to remember the past memories and cry sometimesEvery night she would share her day events with me and I shared my work experience with her. We started sharing laughter slowly and loneliness vanished from our life soon. We became each other's way of breaking silence and helping each other raise back again.“Sharing can decrease loneliness by % . Sharing is hard. Explaining your feeling with other is difficult but try it. That's the best remedy. Try focusing on other things. Empty mind will make you remember you are alone and you will be depressed. Try making your mind busy.”“There is no magic ways of getting out of our problems and no one will help us except we. We are the one to help us. Loneliness is the state of mind and we can control the things slowly. Good things takes time but they will come surely.”",
                "Nearly two years ago, I lost my father to suicide. Suicide cases are never easy to accept and society makes it even worst. The initial days were hard for all of us.

You're surrounded by life out there, and the amazing sky, and you can sit in a $ Walmart camp chair with a few PBR's, burn some firewood while the coyotes yip, read a good book, wave at the other guy driving by on a dirt road and know that he's probably out here for the same reason, and he'll probably come by to chat, anyway. Then you go back into a crazy city and you're surrounded by millions of people and the loneliness sometimes just gnaws at you there.

Facebook and Instagram, in my opinion, are mostly just ways to brag and cultivate a false, rosy image of your life.

I don't feel lonely while they're out doing cool stuff. I've done lots of cool stuffI stoppedactinglike I was lonely. Seriously, most people aren't going to want to be around you if you look lonely or awkward. Try it. Walk into a room, look really shy, convey zero self-confidence, and see how many people want to talk to you.

Grab a bag of peanuts at the gas station, slink up to the cash register, and act all awkward: it's going to be an awkward sale. Now take your nuts, walk up to the lonely, bored-looking cashier, and say in a commanding, cheerful voice, “Mornin'” or “What's going on, man?” It's like night and dayLast spring, I quit what I hope was the last office job I'll ever have.

To me, success in life isdeliberatelyavoiding a managerial position. Then you're truly “a boss.” :)I stopped beating myself up over being single, especially for not getting married when I was . (I had that chance at , and I dodged it, because marrying her would have been a big mistake. And while I've always wanted to have kids and am actually kind of scared of becoming a lonely old man one day with no family, it also feels pretty good to not have to plan my life around the kids' school year or my wife's yoga schedule. Went hiking in the snow on Mount Baker today. Didn't have to ask a single person's permission. Didn't have to sit at home wiping crayon off the wall and watching Clifford the Red Dog on TV. Boredom makes me lonely, and Clifford would bore me.)Also, most people I know who are married or in relationships aren't very happy. My brother, who has a -year-old, is getting divorced. He sits at home and stares at a fireplace. I feel bad for him, but I think he'd be less lonely if he just got out and breathed mountain airI'm not going to accuse every lonely person of this, but this was definitely true in my case: I was hugely self-centered when I was lonely. I expected the world to revolve around me, thought I could do nothing with my life, not lift a finger, and that women and friends and opportunities would still fall into my arms. When that didn't happen, I went home and pouted like a man-babyAnd while sex is definitely interesting, and the lack of it can make you lonely, sex isn't themostinteresting thing in the world. Personal connection is more interesting in the long run. Porn stars are lonelyCities made me lonely. So I started going camping in what seem, on the outside, like the loneliest places in the world: the Sonora Desert, the Great Plains, and the North Woods. Honestly, I don't think I've ever felt lonely in those places. The opposite is actually true: I feel really invigorated. You're surrounded by life out there, and the amazing sky, and you can sit in a $ Walmart camp chair with a few PBR's, burn some firewood while the coyotes yip, read a good book, wave at the other guy driving by on a dirt road and know that he's probably out here for the same reason, and he'll probably come by to chat, anyway. Then you go back into a crazy city and you're surrounded by millions of people and the loneliness sometimes just gnaws at you there. And you want to go back to the quiet “lonesome” desertSome people feel desperately lonely in Big Sky Country or the wilderness. I'm not one of those people. Though I'm also perfectly fine sitting in a bar chatting with somebody, or bouncing around a European or Latin American city, where I feel pretty alive and less lonesome than I do in our lonesome American cities (some more so than others), where it seems like people are more isolated every yearDoing something for people who are lonelier than you also somehow mademefeel less bad, or at least less self-centeredRight now, I'm doing some deliveries for a package company.

Be cautious of him , a little freedom and the stand will break you downYou always been in dark maybe you are sacred of light. Darkness hugs you around , it's cold but also smooth. Sunlight feels like a thorny park , your steps will bleedyou want to escape but scared of struggle , maybe the reason you are caged are same shortcuts you chooseTears are hold in eyes , scars are visiblein the dept of despair my foots crumbleSongs are my best friendBed is my addressPillow gives me comfortSecretly crying are my gamesDay and night I see passing through windowpillow which I wetted with my tears , blanket under which I hide myself. Boundaries of bed which I don't want to crossed are the chains who locked meAt nights you hear , what going on other side of wallYou are no more in their talks , maybe they forget you allYou are lonely , holding the storm of chaosWishing to escape from prison and sleep on plain grassYour self esteem is futile and life source drowning to fate .You feel like messaging someone , but getting rejected is not beautifulOnly person who hear those voice is meOnly person stayed stayed with you is meWhen I asked who are you , I m your mind he repliedIt's not a self love , self talk we can sayMadness that drive him do, is odd for others but pleasing for himI am you friend,A soul for your soulAre you willing to deal with devil or you will do it aloneI will not let you escape , cause your sadness I thriveHoping to see sun again , but that's not my style.~boss baby🤠Thanku you for reading.",

I hate Bollywood movies, and I don't give a damn about cricket. I always look at things objectively and try to see others as equals but it never works out. Nobody is genuine. Everyone wants to be friends for some kind of advantage: money, curing their loneliness or feeding their egos. I prefer quiet places that have relatively less population. I enjoy the works of Karl Marx, Dale Carnegie and John Grisham. In multiple IQ tests taken, my score has been between –. I am ′ tall and don't have a paunch. I'm fairly good looking and get more than my fair share of attention from women, but I truly don't care about it and totally ignore % women. I am very happy in my own space which I defend with all my energy. I love animals and have so far rescued about a dozen cats and stray dogs, nurtured them and helped them live better lives.

I hate Bollywood movies, and I don't give a damn about cricket. I always look at things objectively and try to see others as equals but it never works out. Nobody is genuine. Everyone wants to be friends for some kind of advantage: money, curing their loneliness or feeding their egos. I prefer quiet places that have relatively less population. I enjoy the works of Karl Marx, Dale Carnegie and John Grisham. In multiple IQ tests taken, my score has been between –. I am ′ tall and don't have a paunch. I'm fairly good looking and get more than my fair share of attention from women, but I truly don't care about it and totally ignore % women. I am very happy in my own space which I defend with all my energy. I love animals and have so far rescued about a dozen cats and stray dogs, nurtured them and helped them live better lives. I hope to use my resources one day to uplift the millions of poor children in India, to give my life a deeper meaning. I don't see myself running behind CTC/BHK/EMI all my lifeSo why am I alone? Here's my perspective:I have never met a nice person in my life. Every single person was egoistic, pretentious, abusive or jealousMy parents were dealing with multiple issues of their own, and used me as a punching bag. I was insulted, ridiculed and physically assaulted all my life. Not even once have I heard a single word of appreciation from my parents, despite excelling in academics and sportsI find most people very immature or just plain stupid, despite their ageAll my life, I have been made fun of for being different. For thinking different. The people I once called friends left no chance to abuse me under the convenient cloak of jokesI hate small talk and fake friendships. It is far more honourable to be aloneMost women I have met looked normal on the surface, but suffered from acute mental illnesses deep down. I have dated some good looking and successful women in the past, but not a single one of them was saneThere is not one person I have met who has genuine passion for something or appreciates beauty in small things. Everyone wants to brag about some stupid degree, soul sucking job, some shitty expensive thing they bought, sexual conquests or comparing with others and bad mouthing others. I am way beyond all of this crap, always have beenPeople everywhere try to cheat me or climb on my shoulder by taking advantage of my kindness. Being street smart is the term given to being a scam artist. Cheat, or be cheated is the rotten mantra of this societyI don't care about religion at all. Please don't advise me to talk to an imaginary friend in the sky. % people are drugged on religion and blindly follow it without understanding the principles, and being shitty people themselves. It is nothing but a huge dramaI have thought of leaving India many times, but I feel that my developing country needs me now more than ever. If everyone like me flees India, there will be only thugs, frauds, criminals and illiterates left. I am patriotic and have a desire to contribute to the betterment of my nation, and eliminate the plagues that it suffers from nowI was once a nice person who held out for the people I loved. Now I'm a cold shell, but atleast I have my sanity intact. Society shoved me into the dirt, and left me to rot. But I emerged as a sapling from that very dirt, and stand tall today with roots firmly in place. I'm a tree that grew up in darkness, and stands alone in the shadows of society. I hope to provide shade and guidance to as many as I can, until I finally die."

Stress is when the body feels like it is being overwhelmed and the mind can not keep up with the information that is coming into it to be processedStress can be from fears, of anything from failure or success, to fear of being in harms way. It can originate from a family member who keeps pushing concerns about finances, and other mundane things that need to be immediately addressed, to having a restricted time frame to complete projects at school or workIt can be triggered just in the discussion about stress tooWhen the mind is placed under the demand of processing too many sensory issues and information at the same time, and it has a problem sorting through the information, it can freeze and just try to work through the process of disseminating everythingThink about that computer at the office, or at home. You enter in information about something, then you open up another tab and do a search function for something, then you click repeatedly on different links and then the computer goes to buffer the information it's receiving and slows down or goes to a blue screenLike the human mind, it gets overwhelmed with information and doesn't know how to process it all at the same time, so it becomes stressed and looks to just reset and resolve what is being asked of itNow, I am sure that I have missed something, but I have faith that someone else will fill in what I missed, but my explanation was just off the top of my headStress can also occur when a person is relaxed and out enjoying an activity, then be suddenly shocked by something that happens, and that person has never experienced beforeStress can be experienced by expectations that something is going to be taken away from us, or that we may be punished and suffer something that will harm us, financially or physically and emotionallyIn hindsight, I am reminded of my late Mother and her attempts at working with a computer. She was a person that wanted things immediately done and she was a very punctual personI used to joke with her and after she was done with her computer, I would walk over to the computer and apologize to it, and tell it that I understood it's plight and pretending that I was consoling the darn thing. It used to get under her skinAnyway, my mom would search for something on the computer and it would take a few minutes to provide what she was looking for. While she was waiting on the computer to pull up the information, she would click insistently, I am guessing that she thought it would speed up the processWith her clicking the various links, trying to hurry the system up, the system would freeze up, or just say forget it and go to the blue screen and reboot.

There is a mighty truth in how unnatural and painful it is for a child to preceed there parents in deathWe have three sons who are still with us, as well as seven grandchildren that we are quite in love with. I will tell you a bit about my life as a young child and as a teenagerI was adopted in the state of California at age four by a very old couple. The husband was born in and the wife not long after that. I was born in . The adoption was in . He was a hitter. He liked to hit to teach or to discipline. A ruler. A flyswatter. A belt. A heavy wood yardstick. His hands. A car antenna on an especially painful afternoon when I was five years old. He was also a pedophile that spent his teen years abusing his younger sister. Later in his life he would molest his own grandchildrenI was not allowed to know that I was adopted. I found out by accident when in a fight with my niece who was also adopted but who knew she was and also knew that I had been adopted as well. It suddenly all made sense to me. The ages of everyone etc... I finally was told the big secret that everyone had been made to keep from me. I died inside immediately. There was no feeling of any connection to any of them ever againThe decision was made to move us to Klamath Falls Oregon. It was soon after my confronting them about the truth of my adoption and my acting out in school started getting them unwanted attention. About three months after settling in Klamath Falls I ended up taking a car that had the keys in it. I decided I had enough of the physical abuse and that I would go back to where I grew up and start a search for my real mother. It was a bad decision that led to my getting five years in a place called Mclaren Training School For Boys. I would end up staying there for five years. I could have been out in six months, but I was so mentally ill from all the years of abuse that I could not earn my way out on parole. I ended up living in high security programs. The highest security for juvenilles in the state at the timeI went to the hole fifty seven times while in Mclaren. Once I was in solitary confinement for nine months at age fifteen. I experienced everything from being chained to the bunk with metal and leather restraints for days at a time, to finding ways to amuse myself by obtaining razor blades and slashing myself to the point of needing over three hundred stitches in one sitting. I was found to be seeking attention, so they ignored my need for mental health treatment. And ignored it and ignored it and ignored itEventually during my sixteenth year I was found to actually have Major Depressive Disorder as well as chronic PTSD and chronic Anxiety disorder as well as Dysthymic disorder. These are now covered by mostly the same diagnosis. I was eventually placed in the Oregon State Hospital in the Children and Adolescent Secure Treatment Program on ward cI stayed in the hospital about a year or so. I took medicine and lots of talk therapy. I eventually went to community college and was allowed to go out on my own into the community. I reached the day when I had to return to Mclaren and get ready for my release. I spun out in a short time and was back in solitary in no time. I stayed there until my eighteenth birthday and was verbally terminated by the original sentencing judge. I was given a ride to the bus station and a one way ticket back to the adopteds. I stayed there two weeks before going to Portland Oregon and testifying in federal court against the state and Mclaren School for neglect, abuse, and tortureEventually I went in the Army. I made it thru basic training and went to school in Virginia at FtLee for AIT. I graduated and went to permanent party in Grafenwohr Germany. I was there about a year and had serious PTSD start to develop. I was discharged due to psychologica l difficulties. I eventually ended up on skid row before I was twenty years old. I then went to prison for forty four months for a robbery that was actually an attempt at suicide by copI lost my best friend due to suicide. He had spent almost day for day with me in the hole as a kid. I had known him since age thirteen. After being released from adult prison at the age of twenty one he was wanted for a crime he committed. One night he was being pursued by the police. He chose to hide in some random house. He took the family who lived there hostage. For keith this had to be an act of extreme desperation. I later would find that Keith had actually committed a drug robbery of several released prison inmate gang members .He knew he could not return to prison without being in terrible jeopardy. He would have to hide by going into protective custody. That was something Keith would never doThe police responded by cordoning off the immediate area. Every once in awhile keith would shoot in the direction of the police. I believe he was hoping to be killed by the police returning fire. In middle of the night keith decided to let the people out of the house. He had them walk towards the police. I know all this as I lived in a dorm in the prison at this time. Dorms had hour TV. priveleges. The police were talking about keith on most of the areas television channels. After letting the people go keith apparently went into the basement. At some point during that night keith decided to shoot himself in the head. He was dead at .We had agreed when we were kids that if one of us died or commited suicide that the other would not let him go alone. We were to take our own life. Becoming brothers forever. I intently debated this pact on learning of keiths death. I wondered what keith must have been thinking as he pulled the trigger. Of course I have no way of knowing for certain. I feel that I let keith down. I did not choose to honor our pact. I chose to live. To give it all one more try. I had no idea of my future. I just felt the need to not die in prisonI made it out of prison. I had been paroled. Soon after my release I was hired as a bouncer in a very violent downtown Portland bar. I would meet my wife to be in her apartment about a month after getting hired. We were introduced by friends of ours who were dating. I knew him and she knew her. Amazingly we have been together over years. We have five kids and seven grandkids. Our oldest daughter died from complications of drug addiction. The rest are free from crime. Free from institutions. Free from drugsOn Thanksgiving Day of I was taken by surprise when I received an email from my birth mother. I had been trying to find her my entire life. This would be the first contact with each other in any way since . We were introduced by a first cousin that I met through a DNA database kept by and me. My mom and I were reunited about two weeks before Xmas . She immediately planned to visit me. She told me she had never been on a plane in her life. She said she was always terribly afraid to fly. Yet she came to Portland Oregon within days of our being virtually reunited. We had been seperated over years. I now have my mother in my life. I have recently been cured of Hep-C. However it did its damage. I have stage cirrhosis. But I survive. I repeat I continue to survive. Never give up!UPDATED WED. MARCH 2021My wife has a lifelong history of chronic agoraphobia and chronic panic attacks and extreme anxiety. Unlike most people she had in her life I did not exploit these issues or use her illness against her. She had been the victim of a severely abusive former spouse. A very sick individual that would use her illness against her. If she did not do exactly as he wished he would punish her by exploiting her panic disorder and agoraphobia. Her own family, mother included put her in the role of a subservient person with little worth unless she was doing exactly what her family wanted. Very early in our relationship we established a trust with each other that looking back seems impossible. She could trust me not to use her. I would not and have not to this very day ever used her illness against her. She has helped me with my mental health issues. She has been my rock in life whenever I needed grounding. She has the heart of an angel. She helped me to stay alive when life seemed hopeless. Her strength kept me from returning to an institutionalized form of life. She gave me love. She let her children love me. She let me love them. She gave me two of our children in common. She provided a family for me to raise and I daresay a family who helped to fill alot of what was missing in my life. To say that it was an unusual pairing is an understatement. We are now on our year together. We are years married and we just welcomed our grandchild into our family. We have lived thru the passing of our oldest daughter due to opiate addiction. We remain a strong family. We are united even though my children have established there own homes and are at the helm of there own families. My wife and I are your everyday grandma and grandpa on the surface. Underneath we bare the scars from the battles we have fought, but they are hard to find. I am in school pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice. It is my most fervent desire to be of assi stance to young people who have been victimized. I would like to be of assistance to any victim who needs help. Understanding victimology and what breaks a young person so that I may assist them to recover there lives would be the best use of my experiences.

Damon and Ronnee and familyFEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST MACLAREN SCHOOL FOR BOYSInmates of Oregon's MacLaren School (a facility for adolescent wards of the juvenile court system, located in Woodburn, Oregon) filed a class action lawsuit in US.

They also complained of unconstitutional violations in the areas of due process of law, forced involuntary servitude, right to privacy, freedom of religion, and equal protection (such as failure to provide fire and emergency procedures, use of corporal punishment, failure to provide administrative hearings before discipline, and overcrowding, all of which are regulated by Oregon laws in adult correctional facilities).On February , , the US. District Court for the District of Oregon (Judge James M. Burns) granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, detailing specific requirements that the defendants had to meet before they could be found compliant with the Constitution.

It got to the point where I'd be in my room wearing headphones to drown it out, I was only years old and listening to words no daughter wanted to hear their father use, especially to a woman she'd grown to loveOne day my dad did address the fights.

He went out that night and came home in the early hours, having lost his wallet at the beachI'd also like to point out that from my perspective, my dad was always the one angry and with a raised voice, shouting, with no awareness of who was aroundAt the end of the holiday, we were in a restaurant and things weren't any better. My sister fell down running, my dad naturally went to pick her up as he was closest. However my sister wanted her mom, she cried and put her hands out, she was always a clingy mommys girl. Of course my stepmom went to get her, but my dad pulled her away and shouted. (I find it hard to remember what he was saying as I headed to the bathroom). I could still heard him shouting from the toilets, and actually heard a waiter kindly ask if he could go to the back - where the bathrooms were. At the back of the room he went full out screaming, my sister right in front of him; he proceeded to shout “you're an absolute disgrace and I fucking hate your guts” to my stepmom. As a successful woman with her head screwed on, she of course was mortified, and came into the toilets where she met me at the sink, I gave her a small smile which she bravely returned. She took my hand and we went back to the hotel and watched a movie. I'm not sure when my dad returnedWe were all happy to be home. By this point I had told my own mom during phone calls home what had been going on. As someone who had experienced my dad first hand, she was pretty worried and knew it was serious.

Two days after Christmas we were having a family dinner with people coming over. My sister was going through the terrible twosome stage and had her hand in the toilet messing around. My dad caught her and aggressively shouted at her. My stepmom asked him to stop shouting and consoled her crying. He was mad that he was “being made out as the bad guy” and shouted at them both. There was an explosive argument and I was asked to pack my bags. My stepmom did the same. My dad chucked them down the stairs along with hers. He kissed me and said goodbye as if nothing happened when my stepmom drove me homeIt was hours earlier than my mom was expecting me, and she wasn't home. So I went to my grans. It was in the car on the way that my stepmom said to me “I think your dad and I will be splitting up.” I simply said “I know.”We got to my grans and as Shona got the bags out of the car, I broke down in tears. Like real breakdown. I couldn't breathe or speak or even move. When I composed myself a little, I told her “It's so unfair” she hugged me as tight as ever and said “I know but it'll be better now.”I got to my grans door and smiled before hugging Shona goodbye, told her I had a rash on my face (really redness from crying) and was really tired, she gave me some cream and I went into the spare bedroom and cried for hours on end. Until my mum came and I went out smiling again. I was never one to show emotion in front of anyone, which was hard being a highly emotional personI made the decision to stop seeing my dad in the new year. It wasn't hard. I knew he was a toxic person and that I was only really seeing him as a way of seeing my stepmom, who I realised was a far more important person in my life, and she was more than happy to keep in contact with me. We called a lot and she helped me. And I saw her and my sister all the timeMy dad and his family are all pretty toxic. He took my mom to court and blamed her.

They didn't stop fighting and it even went as far as a restraining order on my uncle who wouldn't leave our street.

He truly was brainwashed by his own parents, who always told him - and made it clear to my mom and stepdad - that it was all my mom and stepmoms fault; that he was innocentContact with my sister and stepmom slowed down a lot, it would often go months without seeing them, which was hard. I always thought they didn't want to see me or had forgotten. It's still kinda like that. It'll never be the same as it once wasI understand my story isn't quite a near death experience or one individual moment of fear. However it is something I'm still dealing with and will always have to deal with. Those years of my life were truly traumatising. I'm still not the person I used to be and never will be. I never will be as happy and confident as I once was. Although I do hope some of it will come back. If you do take the time to read my story then thank youI'd also like to say that Shona is in a much better place now that she's no longer in an unhealthy relationship. She remains in contact with my dad for my sister to see him. He is not at all civil with her, but she is mature and handles the difficult situation well.*name has been changed for privacy reasonsEDIT: I never post anywhere on anything, but I thought Quora would be safe as not many people would see or interact with me, but the views on my answer are mind blowing. .k, wow.

However my sister wanted her mom, she cried and put her hands out, she was always a clingy mommys girl. Of course my stepmom went to get her, but my dad pulled her away and shouted. (I find it hard to remember what he was saying as I headed to the bathroom). I could still heard him shouting from the toilets, and actually heard a waiter kindly ask if he could go to the back - where the bathrooms were. At the back of the room he went full out screaming, my sister right in front of him; he proceeded to shout “you're an absolute disgrace and I fucking hate your guts” to my stepmom. As a successful woman with her head screwed on, she of course was mortified, and came into the toilets where she met me at the sink, I gave her a small smile which she bravely returned.

This time I heard her clearly.“What is happening to Shayan!!!”I jumped out of chair, and opened the door of my room to witness something, I most sincerely wish no parent has to witness! My son Shayan was dropped and unconscious, totally collapsed on the floor right there in front of meMay lord have mercy!I grabbed my son and rushed outside while my brother got his bike, I looked at Shayan, and his face broke my heart. Completely unconscious! I don't know he was breathing or not. While rushing to the doctor on bike, I shook him hard; screaming his name hopelessly in panic. “Shayan, wake up”. “Shayan, what happened to you, son”.Right then, I thankfully realized of Resuscitation! And quickly gave him mouth to mouth breathing twice, ; Shayan opened his eyes hardly, and vomited. Very dull, very weakly he moved a little.

I cannot think of any other reasonShayan still has fever, but he's fine otherwise. He's on medicine but he's relatively active and I think I'm satisfied with his condition now, he's recoveringThanks goodness, he's okayBut what do I do with that heart-wrenching memory of looking at him laying on the cold floor miserably after he collapsed unconscious, how do I forget that I held and carried my son and he wasn't moving, he felt nothing like but just a weight. What do I do with that experience of panic, pain and horror when I wasn't sure what is happening and is my son going to wake up or not!I had never thought of going through something like this with my child, I want to scream in pain so god-damned loud that it bursts my lungs or something. I want to drop so many tears, I want to say that I have gotten very terrified in a way that I felt never before. The emotional shock has been way too overwhelming to handle but of course to any naked eye, I'm looking perfectly stable and fine as always in home or at workI wish him good healthy long lifeAnd I most sincerely wish and pray that you reading this; never get to experience a panicking horror like that!

Then imagine the overwhelming fear that stays with you when there is a noise, or a smell, or a colour, or a song that makes you immediately feel like you are back in the situation. Then imagine that everything you remember about the person who was supposed to love and protect you is about fear and horror but you still blame yourself because there is no way someone could be that evil. Imagine not being able to hold down a job because every time you hear a mad voice, or someone asserting authority you disappear completely from the situation because your body thinks something is going to happen again. Take all of that and multiply it and then you might have a small understanding of what trauma is.",

We went to the store in his truck. He drive thru fields on the way back and got stuck in a ditch. I was pissed cause I hated that kind of shit. We walked over miles back to his place, he got his bosses tractor and I got Tara's car. We picked up the girls and drove to the truck. He backed up to the truck but couldn't get the tractor to start after he hooked it up. They got back in the car which was Chevy cavalier soft top and I drove back to his house. About an hour later Kate and Mallory show up. Him and Kate didn't get along cause they were fucking but he quit and so they had issues. He said why don't we go and try to get the tractor started since it was his bosses and he needed it for work. We were out in the country and he lived on a farm. So I said okay but I'm driving. I drive to the tractor and he tried to get it started but it wouldn't. He got back in and I headed back to his place. He had the dome light in and was loading a bowl. We were laughing and talking about the girls and shit. We were on gravel and I was doing the speed limit and topped a hill. When I hit the bottom of the hill I started fishtailing and he said “fuck we're dead” and we rolled once. I came to laughing from adrenaline. He was sitting there like he was sleeping. I said Gowie and nothing. I said it again and still nothing. So I smacked his left cheek and nothing. I reached over and turned his face towards me and blood poured out of the top of his head like it was being poured out of a pitcher all over me. I was like fuck. I patted him down for his cell and couldn't find it so I got out and went to his door and opened it. I knelt down to search around his seat and when I looked up at him silhouetted it was like I had seen it before. Like I dreamt it when I was a child. I said out loud fuck I knew this was gonna happen. I couldn't find the cell and so I started walking. First I grabbed my stocking cap that was on the back floor. I went to put it on and it felt weird so I lot my lighter and it was soaked in his blood. I went to a farm house about a mile away and knocked but only a dog barked. So I went back to the car and started it which it did but it wouldn't move. We did a when we rolled and it took the tire off the front and the rim and all off the back.

I was taught in school what to do so I put myself behind her and started pushing above her stomach, but as you can imagine I didn't have much strength as a years oldMy mum, whom I had been desperately calling from the beginning, rushed in our bedroom and started taking my place in doing the “move” but nothing was working.

The key is how you deal with itI was sexually abused as a child so in turn that event sent me down path of self-destruction. Or at least the attempt at it. The thing is that I wasn't even aware of what I was doing. So we go from age of four to where I suffered another tramatic event. Which set the stage for me to pick the wrong men, take care of everyone else but myself, be afraid all the time. My anxiety was so bad I ended up losing my job, my friends, and almost my children and familyI'd always went to therapy and took medication but nothing was working. So in when I was my father passed and I almost lost my mind. My therapist about months after my father had passed suggested that we do something different because I was getting nowhere. She suggested trauma therapyAs I tell her now she saved my lifeOpTrauma theapry was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. It's not for the faint of heart and if anybody ever does look into trauma therapy just be sure you are ready to relive what set you down the path of destruction. I'll never be cured, I'll never get over it but now it doesn't rule me. I have no more anxiety but I have to stay aware of myself and my emotions to make sure I don't slip back into old habitsI'm no longer afraid of men or crowds, my mind's much clearer and for the first time in my life I feel normal and okay and I have hope. But for the rest of my life I will have to always check in with myself to make sure I am doing okay to ensure that I don't let myself be sucked back into the viciousness of the trauma cycleOne thing that does get me through is the fact that we are the products of our experiences. And if those experiences did not happen you may or may not have made different choices. And and in doing so miss out on important things. I know my oldest daughter is here because of bad choices on my part because I was trying to deal with trauma at not knowing I was traumatized if that makes sense. So if I'd been a healthy year old I would never put myself in the position that I did and then I would not have my daughter and that would be heartbreak. I love her and my grandchildren beyond measure and to think that they would not be here if the abuse hadn't happened to me as a child is unthinkable.",
