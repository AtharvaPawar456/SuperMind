        "text_body": "Hey everyone,I've been part of this community for about a week now, and I'm really moved by the peaceful and inspiring stories shared here. I'm on a journey to embrace simple living and find more joy in the little things.One of my favorite moments recently was spending an entire afternoon reading a book in the park. It was such a refreshing break from the usual hustle and bustle.What are the small, simple things that bring you peace and happiness in your daily life? I'd love to hear your experiences and ideas.Thanks for sharing and being such a wonderful community!Read more",

            "Noticing all the things that give you joy is a vital part of simple living.I work from home and there are days that I don't leave the house. I have to purposely schedule in walks or I get too busy to effortlessly slot them into my day. A 1-2 hour walk somewhere lovely is good for mental health and for my body. I always feel refreshed after a walk.Smaller than that is having a 5 minute break from my work to canoodle with my pet rabbits. They usually snooze and cuddle with each other during the day so I interrupt that and thrust my face upon them. One rabbit loves kisses, the other only tolerates them but it gives me joy to kiss them.",
            "I love rabbits!  What kind do you have?As for walks, sometimes I use the Randonautica app just for a different kind of walk.  I found it during lockdown in 2020 and it's really fun.",
            "I hate that it's out of my control, but whenever it rains hard, especially when it thunders, I'm completely capable of just stopping whatever I'm doing and just existing. Sometimes I'll even go into my garage and just sit down and watch the rain.Something else that I've started doing recently is just listening to music. Just listening and not doing anything else. Most of my life I never liked to have music on even in the background, but now that I'm in my late 30s I'm finally starting to get into music, listening to all the artist and songs I heard people talk about for decades, finally understanding what the fuss was all about. A few weeks ago I sat down and listened to a whole Pink Floyd album front to back. That was the first time I ever just sat down and focused on music for that long. Now it's like a whole new world has opened up to me, because plenty of music is an experience all by itself. It doesn't need to be attached to a movie or a videogame, it's the full package by itself.",
            "Dark Side of the Moon is usually the Pink Floyd album people listen to first.  If that was your choice then it's excellent, but can I also recommend Animals as a second PF album and then their song Echos!",
            "Ok, so don't mock me, but I love cleaning my kitchen.  I have no idea why, but it just brings me joy.  It might be the smell of the cleaning supplies or just the scrubbing which frees my mind, I don't know.  But it's so peaceful.I also love going to my mom's house and visiting her dog.  Her dog is a chihuahua mix and is the most chill, zen dog in the world.  She scoots over when I'm sitting on the sofa so her butt touches my hip and she just sits there, almost mindfully.  I rub her head and if I stop, she lifts her left paw to swipe at the air twice and I know that's her telling me that I'm not done yet.  hahaI love to cook and feeding people I love is a blessing.I love taking socks fresh out of the dryer and putting them on.  So cozy and warm.Fresh iced tea is a joy.",
            "A morning at the library, followed by a hot or iced coffee and reading at the park.I love going for drives. I love exploring random roads and discovering dead ends and new places. I park and watch people and animals go by.",
            "Going to the ocean and taking in the vast blue is my favourite way to lift my spirits and find serenity. I also love reading in the park as well. That still time in nature is a great restorer. I love reading poetry at night with my beloved. A long bath with candles and sacred music. Baking bread, the waft of it through the house and making a traditional hearty soup, it's almost winter here. Painting on canvas is very healing for me, or just drawing. Reading a magical novel tucked in bed with tea whilst it rains outside is bound to bring a lot of calm. Gardening brings you back down to earth, grounds you and heals many people. Oh gosh there's just so many beautiful ways to find that peace.",
            "The most peaceful part of our day is when the sunlight is going down, my husband plays his guitar and I knit. A simple thing.",
            "My peak Simple Living day was about a month ago. I awoke before 8am with no plans for the day. I decided to go to breakfast, then took a bus (since I sold my car to my son and choose not to own one) to the mall to get the Doc Martens shoes I've been wanting for a few months, where, when I was telling the salesperson I couldn't decide on black or brown, a random woman with her husband said, ‚Äúoh go with the brown, you look really good today‚Äù üôÇ, then to the lakefront to take a picture of me looking good üòÅ to post on a dating site, then cleaned what I felt like cleaning and worked on what I felt like working on. I aspire to be that guy all the time.",
            "Today I took a walk around my neighborhood and took photos of the flowers people have in their yard (near the sidewalk of course). So many roses to see right now and I met and talked with a neighbor.I live near a university and take classes in English literature through their community ed program. I love the lack of pressure and it's fun to talk with other people who also love reading.I recently bought a ukelele because I like to sing. I learned \"Jesus Don't Want me for a Sunbeam\" by the Vaselines."

        "text_body": "I'm 43 years old now, I have experienced many traumas in my life that caused me to have major depression for most of my adult life.  Three years ago, I had come to certain realizations of myself and my surroundings, accepting what was which helped release my depression.  Over this time I have had bouts of inner peace.Over our lives people discuss the values of finding peace, article after article saying that peace is all you need.  When I first experienced inner peace I didn't know what to think because I didn't think during these moments.  After the peace would fade I would contemplate it.  I would go by other people's vision where you should seek to hold onto this peace continually, so I sought more peace.Inner peace only showed itself in moments of realization of self and surroundings.  The only way to do this was to ask questions about self and surroundings to find answers.  Some bouts of inner peace lasted weeks, others lasted minutes.  Upon asking myself certain questions lately I came to the realization of what inner peace is.Inner peace is void of emotion, an empty mind, a slowness to a pause.  There was no satisfaction in the moment just emptiness.  It's almost like you are asleep experiencing only the void.  I do not understand what could be gained from this.One's life is always changing, for me my beliefs are always changing after finding answers and even those answers change with more answers.  My life is very simple as I am a simple person, mentally I am just not capable of societies demands, so I sit and question life.  Perhaps my understanding will again change over time.EDIT:  I kinda wonder if a lot of you posting even read my post rather than just the topic headline.Read more",

            "Your definition of peace and being able to find it may be in error‚Ä¶ mindfulness can never ‚Äúget‚Äù you anything. Love, peace, serenity, happiness. For me mindfulness showed me what's there in the undefined, and that being there with that, is ultimately peaceful, once you drop it all. If you're feeling like your experience is empty or void, maybe ask yourself what you were expecting to be there, and whether that expectation was the issue.",
            "For me inner peace isn't achieving a state of nothingness. That sounds more like detachment than anything. It's mostly been about not resisting what is happening so much and getting my body out of that sub perceptual fight or flight feeling.You want to feel more in tune with everything around you. When I feel more at peace and at ease my focus and internal dialogue is generally less about myself and more focused outward onto the world on others and things. I'm more likely to share with others and want to connect. I'm able to see reality more for what it is rather than projecting on to it through insecurity and anxiety. I also feel emotions more deeply as I'm more in touch with them rather than resisting them.",
            "The teachings talk about this. It is the problem of emptiness. The wrong type of emptiness..",
            "M26, same, same. Gl Hf",
            "I think if we find ourselves suffering, join the club. Then begins the quest to relieve our suffering.  We try everything to satisfy our senses but then the 2nd rule of the universe kicks in (It all changes). Back to square one.With samadhi (jhana practice) we do find relief, temporarily while we are meditating, but we can't meditate forever. So back into the world we go. But now we somehow go in differently.  Our mindfulness/investigation that we do when Samadhi kicks us back into the world, has now changed, as if the samadhi has sharpened a knife that we now wield to go deeper into the world. Then surprise, surprise, as each worldly experience that we once believed was full eventually becomes empty, right along with that emptiness, and in concert with it, comes an exposure to something quite inexplicable like a new realty that we can't really explain - But boy do we feel it.",
            "To me, that's sounds more like shutting down than peace. I think the inner peace has more to do with appreciation and confidence we can properly handle difficult situations. Maybe the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh could be relevant?"

Many people say the peak of your life.I am quite an unhappy person. I am lucky to be intelligent enough, I have a nice family, some good friends. However this is counterbalanced by my high levels of anxiety and lack of motivation.I am currently doing a degree which I've only recently realised is notentirelyuseless but not particularly versatile. I also don't enjoy it one bit and don't really want any jobs relating to my degree anyway. I have no passion for any particular job. I really wish I did.Because of my general and social anxiety I often dread having to work for the next 40-50 years of my life. I don't deal with stress well at all. All the networking, meetings, presentations, smalltalk, being told off by bosses, the independence and responsibility... It fills me with dread.I want to escape this life but have no realistic way of doing so.I dream of having a small plot of land where I can garden most of the day and go on runs/walks whenever I want and read books and meditate.

Do something else.I want to escape this life but have no realistic way of doing so.Of course you do. No matter what you can think of, someone out there will pay you to do it.",
            "Yeah 20 years old is in no way a peak IMO. In my experience, life gets better over time. You learn from your mistakes. You become more of yourself. Hopefully you heal your childhood trauma, to whatever extent that's possible. You slowly evolve into the person you were always meant to be. In the US, public education and even sometimes college is really just weird indoctrination. Suffering is part of life and without the bad days we wouldn't know what a good day feels like. Just don't give up and things will get better.",
            "Hi friend. You're doing just fine. These are great realizations you are having.A few thoughts:-If you are close to finishing your degree, I'd recommend finishing it. Having a bachelors degree opens many doors for employment. Many jobs don't even care about what your degree is in and care more about your skill set, soft skills, etc.-If you love gardening that much, what if you found a job gardening for someone else's land? There are likely landscaping companies that may offer some further education about horticulture that may end up being useful to your own garden in the future.-What about a career as a park ranger, grounds keeper, or something to that effect?-You do not have to live a life at a desk job. There is a whole world out there. Let the anxiety of being doomed to a certain type of job go. You are in control of your life. There are ways to design your life to meet your goals. In fact, I'd recommend the Design Your Life book (with the workbook). It may give you the planning and foresight you are looking for.Your whole life is ahead of you! Best of luck.",
            "There's no such thing as a stress free life. And there is good stress and bad stress. But you're not in a spot to hear that right now.As others have posted, there are alternatives. I would suggest that you find some line of work in which you can be your own boss; that way the motivation to progress is not imposed upon you; it comes from you. But you will have to work because your dream requires money and not just a tiny amount. At your age and if you iive in the US, you will be largely responsible for your expenses for when you cannot or don't want to work any longer.So maybe what you should do now is find a counselor who can help you explore the issues behind what tbh sounds a little like depression. That person also can reflect to you some common threads of interest and concern to you.",
            "Your feelings are perfectly normal and reasonable.  No one wants to work a 9-5 job, but we do it because we can use the money and benefits to build a life that appeals to us.  I also would love to spend time in the garden all day, take hikes everyday, and care for stray and abandoned cats.  But I need money for food, clothes, shelter, transportation, so I have to work.But not all jobs are created equal.  I have a job that is not physically demanding, is a short 10 minute commute from home, and one which does not create extra stress in my life.  My job pays for gas in my car so I can go hiking after work and on the weekends.  My job pays for a house where I can live by myself and get away from the world every night.  My job pays for delicious food.Tldr: Try to find a job that allows you to live the life you desire in the evenings and on weekends.  It's not perfect, but it feels worth it to me when I get to hike out to waterfalls and mountains and see beautiful cats on the weekends.",
            "A job like that does sound nice. I think listening to my parents and brother come home from work talking about the crappy sides of their jobs doesn't help. Thanks again",
            "First, Your 20's are not the peak of your life. You have much life to live.Let go of expectations, yours, and others.  I question if you chose the degree or if others expected it of you. Your soul is already telling you it doesn't align with your path.Follow your dream and find a way to support yourself that doesn't suck the soul out of you. It's your life, live it how you want, not as others expect you to.Lastly, If you feel lost and off the path then you are. Life will continue to circle around until you are on the right path. Trust your gut. Be the author of your book, don't let others write it for you.Peace comes from being your authentic self.",
            "These questions at 20 is a great head start, friend.I finally found the peace I was after at 29 by going into the woods alone for a while. A campfire, stars, trees, rivers... something about just witnessing where it all comes from without the chatter cleared it all for me.I can go back to that peace whenever now.The natural world is quiet, it listens to itself, and goes on without any help from our endless opinions. Peace is all around after you stop trying to solve things and just listen.Also, in my 30s with a big quiet garden and can say, you're goals are in the right place :)20s are prickly, hang in and you'll get there.",
            "Use your mind to come up with creative ways to accomplish what you are after. I am 23 and currently work in an office environment. I'm not sure I'm opposed to offices or corporate work entirely, but I'm having some tough times at work these days. In spite of that, I'm still enjoying myself thoroughly outside of work, going on runs, taking walks in the woods, reading, doing puzzles, watching Netflix, etc.But I'm also allowing myself to dream about my next moves and where I'll go. Traveling, jobs, etc., I just keep thinking of what I know how to do, what I could learn, how to get there and what comes next. I don't know, but I'll figure it out. Even now, I have a rough timeline of how I will move from where I am now to where I'm going next. Life is a rich tapestry of experiences. Instead of seeing the things that restrict you (i.e. an irrelevant and unpleasant degree/sector, despising networking and corporate world, etc.), think about the possibilities! Flipping the script and getting excited about future possibility can have a wondrous effect on life.I like to imagine the open road ahead of me with excitement, realizing that I can take the next several years of my life to keep experimenting until I nail down who I am and what I really want. I feel fortunate enough to have a degree already and thus have a multitude of options in front of me. I'm restless, but I'm glad I am aware enough of what really matters in life that I am thinking intentionally about it. I try to accept that the current turmoil is simply a way of currently protecting myself from having a mid-life crisis later. Happy to directly chat via DMs if you want to strategize further how to try things out. Reject the script that life must go a certain way! You're doing great :)",

            "I've found it helpful to start with self-compassion.Pick someone you care about a lot (adult, child, pet - anything goes). Imagine for a moment that this individual ties their self-worth to their accomplishments. When they don'tfeelproductive enough (even though others might judge them to be highly productive), they think cruel thoughts about themselves, don't think they deserve self-care, find it difficult to be present with loved ones, and feel a sense of dread and despair.How would you feel, knowing that this is happening to someone you love?The practice of self-compassion is about turning that lens back onto yourself. The immediate result: relief from the feelings you're feeling right now. The long view: opening the door for future you to feel fulfilled and show up for others in ways that current you never thought possible.Source: about a year ago, I started \"deprogramming\" myself from 15-20 years of the belief (notfact) that productivity and achievement = self-worth.

Here's my advice: treat your work and your profession as a part of your life and identity not as your entire life and identity.It's ok to derive satisfaction from being a respected and hard working law student /lawyer. The problem is when you make that you're entire identity. Then you forget yourself and that doesn't lead to healthy outcomes.Likewise, it's okay to derive satisfaction from your studies and legal career but it shouldn't be your entire life. In fact, you should derive satisfaction from it since work does make up an important part of our lives. However, you should have hobbies and relationships outside of that too.What I'm trying to say is that you need to shift your mindset now. The first few years of practice are difficult. They involve a lot of learning and finding a healthy balance between work and life will be difficult. But if you treat your work as work as opposed to your life, you'll find that you'll feel less guilty about having to be productive all the time.Good luck!",

I believe I deserve praise only if I keep up this facade and the moment I fail in life, people are going to see me as the worthless piece of shit I really am.

        "text_body": "Often, when asked about the friendships I treasure most, I find myself reminiscing about those that infuse my life with a sense of tranquility. One such friendship is with Vera, whom I met during my time in Vancouver. Despite our age difference ‚Äì Vera is over 60 ‚Äì our shared interests made it effortless to engage in deep, meaningful conversations.What stood out about Vera was her ability to navigate life's challenges with unwavering peace and grace. Intrigued, I once asked her the secret behind her tranquility, and her response, though simple, left a profound impact on me: \"Through a lot of hardships.\"In conversations about inner peace, practices like mindfulness and meditation often take the spotlight, but true inner peace, I've come to realize, is rooted in inner strength, forged through overcoming hardships. A quote from \"The Power of Now\" encapsulates this sentiment: \"The down cycle is absolutely essential for spiritual realization. You must have failed deeply or experienced some profound loss or pain to be drawn to the spiritual dimension.\" This rings true for inner peace as well ‚Äî building inner strength precedes finding inner peace.Inner strength serves as a grounding force, providing stability when external circumstances threaten to upend us. It is the unwavering belief in oneself when the world offers little support.Throughout my journey, I've distilled three potent practices that have played a pivotal role in cultivating inner strength:1. Embrace the Moments of Silence and StillnessInner strength finds its roots in our sense of inner belonging‚Äîa deep connection, acceptance, and alignment with ourselves. To nurture this unshakeable foundation, take moments to embrace silence and stillness. By slowing down, pausing, and appreciating the quietude around you, you can reconnect with your inner self. As external distractions fade away, the voice from your heart becomes clearer, guiding you towards inner peace.2. Practice Deep ListeningThe embodiment of inner strength is often reflected in our relationships through the practice of deep listening. This involves letting go of judgments and assumptions, focusing entirely on the other person. Deep listening is an act of love and confidence, requiring the release of control and the need for validation. It is a skill honed by those with true inner strength.3. Find Your PurposeA sense of purpose serves as an anchor in the ebb and flow of life. Regardless of external circumstances, knowing your purpose allows you to stay focused on what truly matters. Discovering your purpose requires introspection: What brings profound meaning to your life? What fulfills you? What are you willing to pursue, even without external validation or materialistic rewards? How can you leverage your gifts to add value to others' lives?In the pursuit of lasting inner peace, let these practices be your compass, guiding you towards a profound connection with yourself and a resilient inner strength that withstands the tests of time.Written by Tracey Zhang, a purpose-driven writer, coach, and spiritual healer who helps individuals build a strong inner self through major life transitions.Read more",

            "If you want to find true inner peace, remember this- peace you don't have to find. You just have to still your mind. Because peace is already within us. We have peace. It's just like a still lake. You don't have to make the lake still. You have to stop the ripples, ripples that are created by throwing a pebble in the lake. Those pebbles create ripples. What creates ripples in our mind? It is the mind that bombards us with thoughts -,50 thoughts a minute; 50,000 thoughts a day. How can there be peace of mind? We have to remember that if we want peace, then we must eliminate the mind. Where there is a piece of mind, there cannot be peace of mind. People always say that they want peace of mind. Peace is within. Still the mind, kill the mind, eliminate the mind. And peace you will find.",

            "I think they are connected when you introduce wisdom into the mix. So being at peace will almost always lead to happiness. Thats how it worked for me at least.They are separate when your happiness is unfounded and is merely a state of euphoria, ignorance is bliss vibe, dont say nothing dont see nothing stance, happiness from exciting events or dependent on other people. All these states, ask you turn a blind eye to the injustices, focus on whats next, and socialize for happiness. You could say these are happy things but they are not everlasting happiness. The longest short term or partial happiness would be from financial security. It relieves a lot of stress, and you can splurge money whenever you are sad to get momentary happiness. That happiness is fine I guess since its you by yourself depending on yourself alone but peace might not be there.Now talking about peace. You already defined it as being satisfied with what you have. It doesn't mean you don't want more and you wont work towards better things. It means you are content, mentally secure with how everything is working out. Things are gradually falling into place and while there are periods of anxiety and stress, they may just be short lived given the greater picture seems to be on path. Thats peace and frankly happiness comes from it when your mind is at ease. Somehow you end up finding more time as well when you know things are falling into place.",
            "What's the difference between happiness and peace? Anytime I wish anyone anything, I start off by saying may you always have pure happiness and peace. It never occurred to me that they may be different concepts. I guess I always thought that peace comes after one achieves their desired level of happiness or what they perceive happiness to be.",
            "Peace to me is a sense of satisfaction with your life and no regrets or longing for anything.",
            "One of the big crazy important understandings of people that has become prominent in the last few decades among psychologists is that people sacrifice their happiness to chase pleasure.Remember, this body and nervous system is adapted to keep us alive in states of relative deprivation with all the biomechanical and neurochemical innovations to stay motivated to eat and make babies in times of scarcity while making stone tools and chasing animals for food.  Evolution did not design us to be happy, it designed us to survive and make copies of ourselves.I study Buddhism, and one of the main idea in Buddhism is that beings suffer because they put too much energy into chasing after pleasure (the second noble truth of Buddhism).  People can get \"unstuck\" from the habits of the mind that don't serve long-term well-being and compassion.  It takes effort, insight, and kindness.",
            "You know how people say \"happiness is a state of mind\"?  I believe that.As far as peace, peace is a state of the soul.Those are my definitions between the two, simply put.",
            "Or simplified: Is relief better then pleasure?",
            "I kind of see the two as intertwined with one another.",
            "Happiness is fleeting. It comes with a ebb and flow. The duality of it is you will be happy some and unhappy some in life.However, if your able to find peace despite a hardship or the fluctuating of good or bad, then that's more of a permanent state of being.If you find peace then you can be at peace during good and bad situations.There's more intricate views I have about this but this is all I'm in the mood for typing out currently lol.",

        "text_body": "Looking at the current state of the world, I wonder if there will ever be a point in human history where peace is actually achievable.I'm not talking about any conflict specifically. I'm talking about large scale wars. History shows us how bad things can get. I'm sure we're also all well aware of the potential for nuclear weapons being used at any point right now. It literally threatens the extinction of all species on the planet.I wonder how many people out of the 8 billion would say 'sure let's have an extinction event'? Yet we're all sitting at home and watching it unfold, powerless.But why are we powerless? Why can't we stop it from happening if it's what the majority wants? Of course here we'd get into the complicated aspects of human society, governments etc.We do have the UN right now and apparently the world is much more peaceful now than before according to history. But it's just not enough. I don't claim to have an alternative solution, but I think if we got enough people to seriously think, we could certainly improve things. We've put sattelites in space, getting along and not bombing each other shouldn't be so difficult.I am not against weapons. I believe weapons are necessary to keep (and sometimes enforce) peace. But there should be certain lines we collectively do not cross. Why do we have enough nukes to destroy the whole planet several times over? How do we feel about weapons in space, just casually orbiting around? How about innocent people, children suffering and dying in some war they have nothing to do with?Can we somehow just collectively say 'nope, we won't allow that on our planet'? We could instead be using those resources to improve healthcare, or to educate the millions of children on the planet that have no access to education. It just feels stupid to carry on like this.I think that we as individuals need to start thinking past the lines that are drawn on a map, the flags, the colours, religions, or difference in opinions; and ultimately - hold our leaders accountable. We're all on a tiny rock, floating through space. It sounds obvious, but if we actually worked together, everyone would be better off. If at all achievable, imagine the benefits of a peaceful world.TL;DR: Just chill ffs.Read more",

            "If everyone across the planet had a shared culture with shared values and common goals, you could get close.  But at the end of the day there are few things working against it.Humanity tends to operate on competing interests.  Even if everyone lives under the same flag, some places will inherently have less.  Less resources, less money, less food, less access to trade.  We have that now, and if you're unfortunate enough to be born into that, then you will likely see less representation when decisions are made.  People at the bottom always resent people at the top.  On the other side of that coin, people at the top have a much ‚Äúeasier‚Äù time governing if they don't have to acknowledge the interests of people on the bottom.Emotional distance is tied strongly to physical distance.  The farther apart people are, the harder it is for them to truly care about each other.  When people grow emotionally distant, ‚Äúothering‚Äù becomes much easier.  Othering leads to resentment, and resentment leads to conflict.I'm pretty cynical so I could be way off the mark, but I strongly believe that people aren't particularly good at living social groups this big or distant.  I hope it's something we grow into as a species, but that's not something that happens on the timeline of 20-30 generations.",

When you do this you might start to realize how insignificant some of the things we think about really are. Overthinking is a difficult thing to deal with at times, but I have found the most helpful thing is to just look at a specific situation and ask myself, ‚ÄúWill this matter 5 years from now?‚Äù That is how you determine what is really worth your thoughts and worries. Hope this helps :)",
            "Get you as many activities as u can,things u love or aspire to become,work on them and keep your mind active and focused on things u can control.shut out the rest of the world.

            "Exercise is definitely an excellent way to quell the thoughts. When you challenge yourself physically (and I mean truly challenge) you have much less energy to spend on overthinking.  And it becomes easier to sleep too. Also,  it boosts your self esteem so it truly is a win win win. If you're able to exercise outdoors you can add the healing properties of nature to the mix. Speaking of challenging yourself- I've found any sort  of challenge can help get you out of your head.  And,  again,  has multiple benefits.  In my past,  I've used marijuana,  alcohol and other drugs to help me with my overthinking-- for me,  looking back,  those solutions caused me far more problems than they solved. But I remember the overthinking was at times so painful and paralyzing that I would have done anything to make it stop.  If you find yourself overthinking in social situations it's best to try and focus on other people.  Ask questions,  listen to answers-- sometimes helping others can help as well.  If you find the overthinking problem for you is too great therapy can really help (if you're able to find the right therapist). I, personally,  would avoid psychiatric help (like antidepressants and other rxs) until you've tried as many other options add you can.  It's not easy and these are all just suggestions.  I hope you find something that helps among your responses here.  Im sure you are not alone in this and glad you asked a question that can help others too."

My mind just can't comprehend how can anyone be so utterly cruel and cowardly towards women, children, people who can't defend themselves or even animals - and sometimes I just wish a violent death upon everyone who destroys someone else's life just \"for fun\". The fact that it seems like this kind of extreme violence is on the rise worldwide yet these criminals often get away with ridiculously short prison time even when caught doesn't help either...Anyway, this way of thinking scares me about myself as I'm aware that filling my mind with these thoughts only does harm to myself as it costs me energy and focus, it makes me feel very tense and uptight and I also believe in the \"hatred breeds hatred\" philosophy - so I know there's actually no such thing as \"justified murder\".Just for some context - I usually try to stay away from \"news\" altogether as I'm fully aware that most of them serve no other purpose than spreading fear, misery and propaganda (I don't even have a TV). Similarly, I typically avoid horror movies (or any movies with too much gore/violence). Same with video games... I just try to not feed my mind with excesivelly violent stories/images - but sometimes it's really hard as there are some great movies/series with really disturbing scenes (which are important for the story). And some of the worst pieces of news will always slip and get to me, no matter how hard I try to look the other way.So, how do you guys come to terms with the state of the world (and mankind) without succumbing to misantrophy and/or dreams of vengeance?Read more",

It's not personal. It's just how it is.Bad shit happens in life but keep in mind the media doesn't generate as much engagement by publicizing the good in society. We are drawn to violence and drama. We are curious, so our attention gravitates to the stuff. We are fed what we eat.Suppose you want to find inner peace. Limit your time in the news or if your job doesn't permit it. Go outside (there is more), look at the people and find beauty in what they do. For instance, it brings me joy to see people admire the sunset or last year, I saw a woman take a picture of a goose. I felt the pleasure she had in the moment just by observing.P.S. The more negative stuff you see and watch, the algorithm will take note and provide you more.

It was the thought that any human is a product of their environment. So every human could become something very different depending on how they grew up or the situations they were in. This means just about everyone has a situation in which they would kill. There's no escaping it, so make friends with it. What's yours? How can this help you understand the situations of other people who cause harm? How can this acceptance of your own violent nature help you understand others?",

I don't hurt people like my abuser did. I am a good person and I even believe that a lot of the time. I have a good therapist. I'm safe. I have a lot going for me.Pretty good for a kid who the stats say should be dead, a junkie, or in jail ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. I'll take it.",
            "Yes, I wrote it about a lot recently. I'm even wrapping up my therapy. Imagine that!I'm not sure if zero symptoms is possible, but when a symptom happens (which isn't too often), it's manageable. I'm also not sure if being calm and happy most of the time is possible, unless you live in a total bubble where everybody caters to you -- shit happens, that's life, and it's good and healthy to be upset when somehing upsetting is happening.Everything else you wrote about I am experiencing 85% of the time. I am really happy with how things turned out for me. As for remaining 15% -- maybe I can get that number up to 90% with some more self-work, but there should be some room for imperfection too, and, well, grumpiness or whatever. Sometimes you just have a bad day, and that's a part of being human too. You can't really banish bad stuff or difficult emotions from your life, that's more spiritual bypassing than healing."

            "Try and understand what you have. The best first step is to know what's wrong with you in the first placeDiscipline A mental illness is your mindset. Your mental health is your emotional state (these two things get mistaken as the same a LOT). Something you may often hear if you ever went to therapy, or even a school counselor is ‚Äúhow long have you been feeling this way?‚Äù The question is directed to determine if the way you're feeling is starting to become the way you think. It takes about a mouth to be able to determine more accurately, that's usually how long a person needs to think in order for it to safely be concluded you are mentally ill. So ‚ÄúHow long have you been feeling this way?‚Äù Is ‚ÄúHave you felt this long enough for it to be your mindset and the way you process things?‚Äù With that said, your mental illness is your mind set, so making a change- which often requires you willing to actually make that changeContacting a professional/therapy. You can potentially more quickly figure out what's wrong with you, and also make a treatment plan with them.

There's nothing wrong with being in this position. Though of course I still feel lonely at times.I also find having background noise when I'm at home helps too - a podcast or TV show or music. I try and see friends/family at least once a week and am trying to get back into doing social things like Netball, exercise classes etc. There are social apps such as Meet Up too that you could try if you want to make some new friends.Personally I would rather be single and living alone right now than in a relationship, with kids etc. Life is peaceful and quiet when it's just me and my dog.You're definitely not alone!",
            "There is a difference between loneliness and solitude. I may recommend an adventure. You need a quest! Live in another country and learn a trade or an art, or reinvent yourself. The profound dialogue will come as you immerse in yourself. But have a concept! Don't let boredom and loneliness get you. These are the feeling of sitting in still water. Solitude will help you know yourself.For example, there are several programs in Europe or Australia where you can get a working visa for a year. Heck, you can study in Europe for free if you are an American. Are you not craving for a relationship? Well, go to Argentina or Italy and those guys will change your mind real quick.It's time for you to go!I felt like this when I was a teenager and around your age, so I left, and it was the best decisions ever made. Don't sit there and rot.  Comfort at your age is a trap‚Äî it does not build anything. And don't look at your friend's life. I married my wife at 38 and she was36 and by now have two small children.

            "I watched a podcast recently on the epidemic of loneliness in society today. The podcast was hosted by a Buddhist trained monk who went on to become a licensed psychiatrist. He said that individualism has characterized Western society for several decades, particularly in America. While that's not inherently bad, it does mean that we expect people to take the horse by reigns so to speak and solve our problems by ourselves.We run into a stumbling block when faced with loneliness,  however. It is the one challenge that cannot be fixed alone. It requires other people who want to be social and invest in community with others. In a world that's increasingly dependent on social media and interacting online, opportunities to interact with others in person are decreasing today.I am going to look for groups in my area to join, such as church fellowship groups and volunteer opportunities at a local non-profit. I try to remember that I am not alone in my struggle with finding positive, face to face social interaction today.While it doesn't solve the problem, it helps me keep things in perspective and not beat myself up.",

It's not important enough. So no matter how upset I am, most of the time I just hold it in. If I just can't hold it in anymore, I'll just blurt it all out to my one online friend whose life is even shittier than mine because he knows exactly what I'm talking about.

            "hi! I'm very stressed all the time (taking 19 credit hours) and i have a severe anxiety disorder! I think i'm very qualified in giving advice on healthy ways to handle stress:-assign yourself an end time for doing school work. I don't allow myself to work after 9:30pm unless i HAVE TO. Try and get a healthy balance between work time and personal time-play video games/ do other hobbies. I love video games. I find light games like Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing to be very relaxing and help take my mind off the things i have to do at school. But if you're not into video games, participate in a different hobby!-meditate. Every day as i'm getting ready to relax in bed for the rest of the night I sit up against the wall, perfectly upright, and meditate for 10 minutes. Resets my posture and allows extra tension to melt away. Also try shower meditation. You can visualize the stress washing off your body-exercise! You hear this everywhere. I don't think i need to elaborate-masturbate/have sex.. just not while your roommate is in the room (if you have a roommate)-watch a movie. And i mean a calming movie. Not something that'll spike your blood pressure. Disney and Studio Ghibli both have great movies to watch along those guidelines-read. I didn't start reading as a hobby until college. I love the escapism that books give-chill out with some herbal (non-caffeinated) tea at the end of the night. A perfect way to wind down after a long, stressful day of doing school work-talk to a counselor/therapist! Even if you're not mentally ill, having someone you can talk to about life is so wonderful. You can even talk to friends or family if a counselor is unobtainable atm-try using some essential oils! Lavender is very good for calming the nervous system and might help reduce stress levels‚Ä¶ i can't confirm this bc i'm allergic to lavender lolI hope something of these tips helps literally anyone out there! It's just a small list of things that have helped me through this hell of a semester. Just make sure you allow yourself this time to relax and unwind or else you'll never truly help the stress!",

        "text_body": "I have been reading quite a few posts around this feeling we're all too familiar with: loneliness. As important and sensitive it is to address, please don't fall into the trap of 'meeting new people and dating them' as a cure to your loneliness. You're essentially handing your happiness into someone else's hands, and that leads to many expectations.Friends and romance are important parts to life. But remember how fragile and temporary these things can be.Instead, focus on these two:Hobbies. These are activities that lie closest to your heart. It gives you a sense of direction, purpose and wholeness that no person can fulfil for you. In my short life of 25 years so far, I have tried sketching, photography, music, stand-up comedy, and many other things. Today, music is the closest to my heart and everytime I pickup my instrument, my energy resonates with those around me. And, of course, fulfils me. This helps me set newer goals within my hobbies.Habits. Adding structure to life is something we innately do. Humans have a tendency to balance order and chaos as life happens. Life may be unpredictable, but your routines and moments of self-care will always bring you back to yourself. To your home.Focus on these two areas for a while and tell me how you feel about loneliness.Forcing yourself to do anything is a bad idea (in my humble opinion). Socialising when you don't want to, holding conversations you don't feel like having and meeting people for the sake of it never works. Ask people who have tried this. If you're lucky, maybe (big maybe) you will strike like-minded individuals.However, building yourself up with hobbies and habits designs your character. You're fundamentally asking yourself to be a person of this world - with experiences and knowledge that stay humbly true to you.. . .A little about me: I study Behavioural Sciences, WFH and live alone. Except for a couple of friends and my dear family, I don't have social ties to heavily rely on. Yet, loneliness doesn't push me to chase relationships for the sake of it.

This got me into a cycle of engaging with different kind of professionals (therapists/counsellors/teachers) and that's how I decided I wanted to pursue something along the lines of Psychology.If charity work comes out of impulse, the innate benefit of it won't really last, don't you think?

            "Have some patience and self love for yourself. For me personally, I have some trouble identifying with my problems and turning it into my narrative. You are not an anxious person, you are someone with anxiety. You are someone who is working through their problems and making small improvements and learning about life and its struggles. Use the right language to express how you are feeling and who you are honestly. You are someone who is much much more than what you posted here and I know how tough it can be to see through the fog sometimes.Don't worry if you can't do things that others can. Don't try and pick fruits that haven't ripened yet. Best way to learn is to live everyday in the present and observe as much emotions, cause and effects, triggers and warnings as you can. As a casual observer of your post, it seems to me that it's social situations that give you the most stress. That's okay, just recognize instances and realize that you might be predisposed to feeling anxious when dealing with situations like those. Build up from the bottom with solid logic and dispel any wrong interpretations of yourself. These things will come naturally if you don't force things, be patient and kind with yourself.Feeling deeply is not a weakness, but it can have its difficulties you can to adapt to to live a more stable existence. There needs to be more people out there who feel intensely and wear their heart on their sleeve. Try and see if your weaknesses can be strengths and don't be judgemental of your flaws - observe them. I too feel very deeply and makes me emotionally volatile - my highs are really high and my lows are very low. It also makes me more empathetic to others, to care for others deeply, and connect with the world around me in a way that few people can. Who are you? Is the self the you who feels and reacts or the person who observes the feelings? You'll find once you practice observing that it's very difficult to be anxious and to be so emotionally volatile. When things get really tough for me I do my best to observe to enter that meta level of self. Take some deep breaths, find the calmness within to see clearly.Sounds like you're making solid progress - make sure to look back at how far you've come! Also remember being 24 (I'm 24 too) is still just late adolescence. There is no race, no rush - we have lots of time to build the self we want to be. Let's work to be wise people who can help others who struggle in the same ways as us. The next generation of children are dealing with depression and anxiety at a whole new level and they will need teachers like us. That's the narrative I'm trying to live as I deal with similar problems. Good luck friend",

Some people thrive in any enviornment (like a dandelion) and others need a particular enviornment to flourish (like an orchid). People still love orchids though.I also always felt I lacked resilience but having had some therapy I've realised that while I'm definitely more of an orchid than a dandlilion I can control my reaction to stress much more than I think. A big improvement for me was letting go of rigid, demanding thinking. (e.g. I Must pass this exam/get this job/get married by X time) and instead be more flexible (I'd love this job/to pass my exam etc. but if I don't I can cope). I've also found simple stuff like mindfulness, gentle exercise and getting enough sleep enourmously helpful. I also try to practise self compassion. How would you react to a friend who was struggling? You wouldn't say 'other people have it harder you should be able to cope suck it up'. You'd be kind and understanding.

I thought I was an incapable human.Through therapy and my own self-education, I learned to accept my feelings and allow them to be there.

I don't like it, but it's temporary.‚Äù And then I would observe how it felt in my body. That's it. And eventually it would pass and I had to practice not being mad at myself or ashamed that I panicked over something I thought was silly. Feelings are just feelings.This was NOT easy.

I eventually made friends at the language classes I went to every day, and I started talking to a friend from home on Skype regularly, and she was someone I had long fallen out of contact with before I went away.

            "A therapist made the following recommendations to us:First - when your anxiety is triggered it's the emotional side of your brain, and like a dog or a toddler, you can't tell your brain to STOP doing something, you have to redirect.  In this case, you have to use the logical side of your brain.  So ‚Ä¶ numbers!  Count upwards by a not-easy number like 3 or 13.  Play the 7s game where you can't say a number with a 7 in it, nor a multiple of 7.  (So, 1 2 3 4 5 6 beep 8 9 10 11 12 13 beep ‚Ä¶)Second - when your anxiety flares up, your body dumps a bunch of adrenaline in your system.  It can take up to 10 minutes for it to clear.  So whatever numbers / breathing / meditation you do?  Do it for at least 10 minutes.Good luck!",
            "Wow, no wonder my ocd, which works with counting and adding numbers, was introduced by my brain to fight social anxiety..",

            "Therapist here (not taking new clients). Themosteffective way to reduce anxiety is to address the source of it, either directly (e.g. do the thing you're avoiding, like taxes or homework) or through insight work (like journaling or therapy). Other tools include diaphragmatic breathing, sensory grounding, progressive muscle relaxation, and exercise. Also, watch your caffeine, alcohol, and pot intake - they can all exacerbate anxiety. Finally, attend to your self-care and biological needs: sleep, nutrition, hydration. Hope this helps!",

            "For general anxiety - breathing exercises like other people mentioned can be really helpful. Find a pattern that works for you.For panic attacks - Grounding techniques. Usually name 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell and 1 you can taste.If you're in a REALLY bad panic attack (this is also used as a method for people with self harming issues), I find holding ice is surprising enough that it'll get me out for a second.",
            "Take your finger and move it like the eye doctor does. Side to side. Slowly. About 6 inches from your face. Focus on it. Do it a few times. It helps me instantly feel less stressed.If you have more time, they have binaural music. Listen to it on headphones and focus on a spot somewhere in the room. I often so it with one hand on my chest, which is where I tend to feel the most stress.Walks are really, really good too. If you have time, listen to music and go for a walk. It fixes so many things.Long term, my advice is to really take a look at what is stressing you and try to make a few changes to your life and how you process stress.",
            "Hey man, also have a stressful job and dealing with more anxiety problems in my early 30s. This is probably not that helpful given your post but I find when my anxiety is building it's almost always because I'm neglecting basic health needs. Food is the first one- if I haven't been eating enough vegetables or haven't been eating enough in general, nutritious foods will have a huge impact on my anxiety levels. I know you said sleep and exercise don't help but for me they are fundamental. I try to run a 5k once or twice a week and the endorphins are like a protective armor against anxiety. Also a huge one for me is caffeine consumption, I never drink coffee anymore because I notice so much more pronounced anxiety when I do. I'll drink a cup of tea in the morning and that's it.A good cognitive behavioral therapist can help. There are some grounding exercises they teach, like paying attention to your breathing rate when you're getting anxious, and slowly tensing each group of your muscles from your toes up to your cheeks progressively to ‚Äòground' yourself in your body.At the end of the day you have to become cognizant of the circumstances that are making you anxious and take them head on. It might be something you are avoiding that you need to address, whatever it is it can be therapeutic to recognize what is making you feel that way and empower yourself to deal with it.Easier said than done but at a certain point I had to face the fact that I needed a lifestyle change to help my anxiety. Now that I have slowed down my work life and gotten rid of some personal stresses I'm amazed how much better I feel, including the attention I now pay to dietary health and discipline exercising.Failing all of that SSRIs can be a helpful stopgap to take the edge off while you work on more fundamental goals. It's my personal opinion they are a bandaid, but can be a crucial tool to get you going in the right direction. I am sure that for many people with different anxiety experiences than mine, such medications can be a good long-term tool.Best of luck! I promise you can do it!",
            "Go to sauna 2-3 times a week ( my best productivity and mental-health hack)I was quite depressed last year due to some issues in personal life + startup not really taking off.Tried meditation, herbs, sports etc.Then I read an article that Fins are some of the happiest ppl on the planet because they do sauna very often. I never liked sauna. It always felt gross to sit there sweaty with random ppl around.But since I had nothing to loose, I was like fuck it, let's try.First time it felt okeish, and I spent only 5 minutes there. But I forced myself to go again, and again.It took me 8 visits to be able to stay in hot sauna for 15-20 minutes. And once you can sustain that, you can finally experience the healing impact of the sauna.You just feel present, relaxed and not giving a fuck. All your bad thoughts just go aways. You are here and now. And even after you are finished and go home, you still feel much better.My sleep is better, my mood is better and now sauna feels like a drug for me. If I don't go there at least 2 times per week, I feel like something is missing.Don't take xanax or other drugs - GO TO A SAUNA.",
            "When I was a kid I remember conversation between my uncle and my mother. My uncle asked my mother if she was worried about whether or not the Russians would drop the bomb. My mom replied No why would she worry about something she had absolutely no control over.Just had a lasting effect on me. I have over the years developed the ability to not worry about things that are beyond my control. Even things at work where they don't work out the way they should If I have done everything reasonable and they don't work out I don't worry about. There's no real point to it."

        "title": "Practical tips to manage loneliness in the city : r/bangalore",
        "text_body": "Hi there,I see a number of posts here asking for ways to alleviate loneliness in the city. Some say that Bangalore lacks diverse entertainment options compared to, say, Mumbai (the beach?), and this adds to the problem. However, I believe that combating loneliness is more about how comfortable we become with our own company.Here are a few things that helped me manage loneliness several years ago. I hope these work for you too.a) Making the most of day-to-day human interactions.I remember I would strike up a conversation with the chef making my omelet in the cafeteria; being genuinely interested in people helps so much here. (Con: I got free food frequently - doughnuts or pastries that didn't get sold during the day. Not good, absolutely not good for your weight.) If you're taking a cab or auto, ‚ÄúOotayitha Sir?‚Äù is a simple social exchange that can help you feel connected.b) Consider a daily affirmation such as ‚ÄúI am enough, and more than enough.\"c) If you have a strong network outside of the city, please make sure to maintain those bonds. These days, I surprise friends with handwritten letters; it's my way of letting them know they are special.d) Stepping out: Instead of ordering from Swiggy or Zomato, please push yourself to step out. If you feel self-conscious about being seen alone, please know that it's okay to feel that way. We are not born self-assured. We make ourselves. Go through with it, like you would a cold shower in the winter. You'll get used to it eventually. Feeling comfortable in your skin is liberating!Similarly, if you want to go to a movie and don't have company. The last couple of times I went to a movie alone, my neighbors were other folks who had come by themselves. These days I don't bother to check in with pals if they want to accompany me; it's too much of a hassle to ask people and coordinate schedules. People with kids especially can be flaky with plans - I don't blame them. Of course, sometimes I need human company, and I then make efforts to reach out to acquaintances.So, recently I tried to persuade a friend to go to a movie alone, but they found it too awkward. Finally, I suggested we go to the movie together but sit separately, so as to gently acquaint them with the idea of watching a movie alone/relying less on friends for company!e) Letting interactions develop organically: The self-assurance you develop will come in handy even when you go to meet-ups, like Board Games meetups or any social settings. Initiate conversation, make an effort to get to know people, have a welcoming smile, and you will find that acquaintanceships and friendships will develop organically. When you are \"desperate\", it becomes harder for people to gravitate to you.f) Pressure-free socializing: If socializing overwhelms you, please try out options such as Cubbon Reads and Bird Watching groups. Cubbon Reads I hear are a ‚Äúsilent reading‚Äù group; people meet in Cubbon Park at a certain time to read, paint, or do any activity quietly. There is no pressure to socialize; you can do your own thing, and bumping into people with similar interests becomes easier. Here are links to the bird walking groups: bngbirds dot com, chat dot whatsapp dot com/ EjzFTpOXHmAIFQmUwfsZGP. These meet-ups are free to attend, they don't cost a thing.g) Showing up: The ‚ÄòPutting Scene‚Äù Whatsapp group (join dot puttingscene dot com) curates interesting events in the city. I find there is so much to do in Bangalore: so many hobby classes, talks (check out the Bangalore International Center), concerts, stand-up shows...Simply show up; if you are bored or feeling out of place, you can just get up and leave.These are tiny steps to make you feel anchored to your city, however, if you're experiencing clinical depression, please work with a therapist. There is no shame.Read more",

            "I'm so sorry, I wish I didn't know where you're coming from but I really do.I lived with self-hatred and disdain and passive suicidality for almost twenty years after escaping my abusers (moved several states away from them and cut all contact).  Ten years ago I started developing fibromyalgia pain that turned into wildfires burning all over my body combined with random nodules of inflammation that no one could explain beyond random inflammatory responses aka \"trauma response\".  Only this year did I realize what I thought was normal childhood treatment was really traumatic, especially  by a mentally ill single mother in a high control religious (cult, it was a cult) group.I'm working with a Psychiatrist, Trauma Therapist, EMDR Specialist, and Acupuncturist on trying to get my physical pain under control while also facing the childhood abuse that followed me, fucking with every aspect of my life without my realizing it.  I knew I was running from something, I knew I wasn't built like other people (insert \"not like the other girls\" meme here) but I had no idea what I was going through was pretty classic trauma response.It sounds like you have good friends who care about you and that's awesome.  I truly hope you can find solace and healing but I'm afraid that won't come from further denial.  Introspection sucks but is necessary, healing comes with hard work and self-care and knowing it's okay to ask for help.Be well my friend, take care of yourself, treat yourself as you would a stranger.

I went catatonic, had my first bipolar episode and my capacity to live a regular life ended just there.",
            "Agreed, Denial isn't just a river in Egypt.I lived in chronic pain for a decade but only realized in January 2024 the true extent of the origins of that pain and I hate it.  It was a culmination of carrying 17 years of abuse, unrealized, ignored and pushed down out of desperation in wanting a \"normal life\".I hate how saturated I am by what was done to me, I feel it in my DNA now.  I had so many \"traumatized child\" symptoms but no one ever put the pieces together, least of all me.  I just thought it was normal to live like that, to be hurt like that, ignored until someone needed to take out their anger on something, c'est la vie right?I've forgotten who I was, who I was supposed to be.  It fucking sucks waking up.That said, I wouldn't go back to before my realization, you couldn't pay me to do that again.Denial was worse, at least now I know what happened to me and I can focus on giving myself the support I never had as a child.  I can reparent myself, I can make a positive difference for others who were hurt like I was hurt.  Never again will I allow myself to think I'm a loathsome, unlovable, object only worthy of the notice of others for abuse, derision, mocking, or disdain.  Never again!I deserve so much better, so do you, it's just that no one ever bothered to tell us that before.  What seems obvious to most is something we struggle to understand.  We deserve, deserved, better.  Healing hurts like a son of a bitch but it's necessary.  Re-wiring the brain isn't easy, undoing all that damage isn't easy, or quick, or enjoyable.  But it is worth it.I hope you continue your journey toward healing, OP.  Hang in there, you're not alone.",

He had a brain haemorrhage due to elevated BP and blood went into his mid brain section. He slipped into a coma and three days later doctors told us that he will not make it and asked us to make a choice whether we wish to continue treatment or not (basically asked me to make a choice between k_illing my father or making him suffer). Seeing my father in ICU like that in a hospital like environment with beeping machines, Lyzol smell etc. Had an impact on me. Finally when the day came where I had to sign a form stating that we don't wish to continue the treatment and I signed it.Now on how it has affected me, whenever I hear a beeping sound, like seatbelt alarms in a car. I get flashbacks of my father in that comatose state. Many a times, I have lashed out on my friends when they don't put on their seatbelts and that fucking thing keeps on beeping.Whenever I have to sign something, I am reminded of that form that I signed to set my father free, and I just think did I rush into that decision, would my father have made it back, I try not to think of it.

            "My trauma was and is related to marriage. I was 17 when it all started. My father died when I was 9 so the only fatherly figure I had in my life were two people and those were both my grandfathers. When I was 17 one of my grandfather(saying GF1) was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease so he had  stopped communicating with me and couldn't form his thoughts properly.although he died later but you can say that I lost one of my fatherly figures then. I don't want to make this about myself,  he was the one who got diagnosed with those diseases and suffered everything but I am telling you how it impacted me. The same year my other grandfather (GF2) died. So now I had no fatherly figure left to help me in any situation. I had always craved and still crave a trustful,  shielding, safe, and secure male support figure in my life. But that is a topic for another time. my bua (father's sister) had the keys to GF2's locker and essentially all the money he had left for me and my brother that was important cause my mother was a housewife and the only source of income we had was what GF2 gave us at the time. So my bua decided that she will only give us everything that my GF2 had left us  if I got married at the age of 18. My mother is not a very strong woman and she had always thought that my bua was a wise and trustworthy person. So she could not refuse her quickly that made me question my mother. How can she think about almost selling me for what this woman was saying. Something that made me loose trust in my mom was also that how can she think of 'making' me marry someone without asking for my permission? Like i was a thing not a human. I would cry silently but violently in my bathroom whenever my bua came to my house and brought up the topic of marriage and later whenever she came to the house i couldn't face her cause I was too scared of her. I would always run into the washroom and cry like crazy and with the running water i would pray that this was all a nightmare. Later I found the courage to tell my mom that I won't marry anyone and especially not if she 'tells' me to marry someone i don't even know. I kept telling her that my bua isn't a good lady and she isn't trustworthy but my mom refused to see the truth it's probably because she also craved a stable human support system that she had lost both my GF1 and GF2 too. Fast Forward to Today 8 years later  we are fighting a case against my bua and my mom now understands that she isn't a good woman. I still sometimes think that my mom wants me to marry someone but that is not her decision to make. It's mine. But i still have trauma left and I know that because the word marriage scares me illogically. If someone in my family tries to bring it up my mind  quickly thinks that they are trying to make me marry someone and then I cry. I am 25, i don't think Ive crossed an age to marry someone but I am still very far away from marrying someone. I don't think by the time I am ready someone will actually marry me. I recently got diagnosed with Pseudo dementia and now on some very high psychiatric medicines and that alone might just be a very big reason to not marry someone. Don't want to ruin their life being all the crazy that I am. I recently drove away my very good support system and a man who was the closest  ever to being a potential boyfriend because I was so irritating and unsure and taking back my words so often because of Pseudo dementia. I don't know if I'll be up for opening up with another man in the the near future. Maybe later. Until then i need to heal first. Cause hurt people hurt people and if you don't heal from who cut you, you'll bleed on the people who didn't hurt you.",

            "If they go out of their way to make/keep everyone happy.  My mom would fly off the handle at a moment's notice and I would have to always be hyper aware of where she was at all times and listen for footsteps to see who it was walking around.",
            "Saying sorry all the dang time.I had this one co worker who wanted to show me her cats and as she was opening her phone she made a mistake and dial the wrong passcode number and had to try again saying sorry and said she should've use Face ID like normal people. And said sorry again. Then nervous laugh.",
            "As a kid I used to think children usually don't like their fathers and are afraid of them, because I thought fathers always beat their kids. My father lives in another state for work, and so did some of my friends' fathers... One day, one of my friends said his father is visiting and I immediately felt bad for him. I made a sad face and looked at him. For my huge fucking surprise, he was genuinely happy, I could see it in his face as he told me the news.It would since take me a few weeks to get out of the confusion and realize that other fathers are usually sweet.But yeah, the torture that my family would get from that individual would just increase over the years.I just graduated and got my first job, I'm planning on moving away from him with mom and sis and arranging therapy for all of us.",
            "No sense of achievement, if they succeed they are relieved, not proud.Constant awareneness and anxiety. Knowing where people are at all times around them.Suddenly being worried by something.

            "anything that triggers intense emotional responses, short term or chronicallyu/kegerboy3, that's something a lot of folks don't know. Trauma isn't always (or even usually) just a single harmful event. It can be a few big events, a lot of small events, or anything in between. Trauma isn't only defined by the peak of stress and strain, but by how often it happens.",
            "Can you give an example of an intense emotional response?",
            "One possible definition of trauma, by Gabor Mat√©A lot of what you talk about is childhood trauma. What's your definition of trauma?It's important to define it actually, because people use the word  like ‚Äògod' and who knows what somebody means when they say ‚Äògod'. It  could be a punitive, dictatorial father figure with a white beard and  somebody else might mean the essence of pure love in the world.The origin of the word ‚Äòtrauma' is the Greek for ‚Äòwound'. Trauma is a  wound. How I think about it is that if I wounded you, if I cut your  flesh, the healing would involve scar tissue forming. If the wound was  great enough, you'd get a big scar, and it would be without nerve endings so you wouldn't feel, and it would be much less flexible than  your normal tissue. Trauma is when there is a loss of feeling and there  is a reduced flexibility in responding to the world. This is a response  to a wound.Trauma is a psychic wound that hardens you psychologically that then  interferes with your ability to grow and develop. It pains you and now  you're acting out of pain.It induces fear and now you're acting out of fear. So without knowing  it, your whole life is regulated by fear and pain that you're trying to  escape from in various ways.Trauma is not what happens to you, it's what happens inside you as a result of what happened to you.Trauma is that scarring that makes you less flexible, more rigid, less feeling and more defended.(complete interview here:https://humanwindow.com/dr-gabor-mate-interview-childhood-trauma-anxiety-culture/?fbclid=IwAR3DrRguOQR6FLBm_VpkhRMtXMuJ6sgl9PlMbh45nWAFf7JFlGbmsBpuVps)",

            "My psychiatrist thinks I have PTSD and she described what could cause PTSD which is a feeling of intense horror and helplessness. This could be a more extreme version of trauma but that's my understanding of it at least in regards to me.",

Trauma is any experience that was real to YOU, and that caused you great psychological hard. And it's all valid.",
            "Whatever is going on with you it isn't any less valid just because you've never had anything traumatic happen to you.Your councilor is probably just trying to narrow down on how to help you.  You treat anxiety different than you do PTSD, depression, psychosis, etc.  I think there are some standard questions they go through to figure out where you land. So she might have said that to double check with you that she was correct.  I doubt she meant anything more than that when she said it.",
            "Anything that triggers a severe emotional response. No one gets to tell you, especially when comparing to their own traumas, what is traumatic. What may be traumatic for you could be totally different from them. So while evoking an intense emotional response is what someone would put down on paper - never let someone tell you what you're allowed to be traumatized by ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
